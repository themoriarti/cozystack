# Cozystack

**Cozystack** is a free PaaS platform and framework for building clouds.

Cozystack is a [CNCF Sandbox Level Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) that was originally built and sponsored by [Ã†nix](https://aenix.io/).

With Cozystack, you can transform a bunch of servers into an intelligent system with a simple REST API for spawning Kubernetes clusters,
Database-as-a-Service, virtual machines, load balancers, HTTP caching services, and other services with ease.

Use Cozystack to build your own cloud or provide a cost-effective development environment.
