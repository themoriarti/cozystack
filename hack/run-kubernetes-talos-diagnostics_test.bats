# Regression coverage for tenant-worker Talos diagnostics in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh. cozytest.sh ends an @test block at
# the first bare closing brace, so command mocks stay at top level.
#
# Scratch directories are removed at the end of the test body, never from a
# `trap ... EXIT`. Such a trap replaces the one the bats binary installs for its
# own bookkeeping, and a test that then fails prints no TAP line at all -- not
# `not ok`, nothing -- so a reader grepping the output for failures sees a green
# suite while the test silently did not finish. Both runners set -e, so on
# failure the cleanup below is unreachable and the directory survives for
# inspection, which is what a failed test wants anyway. See
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md and hack/bats-no-exit-trap.bats.
