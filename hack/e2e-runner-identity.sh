# e2e-runner-identity.sh -- record which machine an e2e run landed on.
#
# WHY THE RECORD IS NEEDED AT ALL
#
# The e2e lanes ask for a runner class, not for a machine. A flex shape is
# filled from whatever capacity the pool has at the time, so the same lane can
# be served by two processor generations; the region is a preference with a
# fallback, so it can be served out of a second one. None of that reached the
# report, which means a red run and a green one could not be compared by the
# hardware they ran on -- the first question anyone asks about a flake that some
# runs have and others do not. That comparison is the whole of what this file
# exists to make possible.
#
# WHY IT RUNS A LAYER ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE REPORT
#
# The metadata service answers on a link-local address. The sandbox container is
# not guaranteed to have a route to it, and a capture that answered "unreachable"
# from in there would be saying nothing about the machine while looking exactly
# like a capture that had tried. So the read is taken on the runner VM, before
# the container exists, and the record is written into the repository tree that
# `packages/core/testing/Makefile`'s `apply` target then copies into the
# container. hack/cozyreport.sh folds that file into the artifact from inside,
# without going near the endpoint itself.
#
# That placement is also what makes the record unconditional. Every workflow that
# runs the suite reaches the sandbox through `make prepare-env`, so a capture
# wired into `apply` is taken once per run in each of them, on the green path and
# the red one alike, with no per-workflow step to keep in step. Written without a
# count of those workflows on purpose: the count is what goes stale, and the
# funnel is the property worth stating.
#
# WHY ONE READ PER KEY RATHER THAN ONE READ OF THE DOCUMENT
#
# The root instance document is the obvious thing to fetch and the wrong thing to
# fetch. It carries the instance and compartment OCIDs, the display name, the
# hostname, the image OCID and the whole user-supplied metadata bag, which on a
# real instance holds authorized keys -- and this record is published as a CI
# artifact. Fetching it and then filtering makes the privacy property something a
# reader has to trust a filter for; fetching the individual keys makes it
# something the wire settles, because the values that must not be published are
# never asked for.
#
# It also removes a guess. Oracle documents the shape sizing under its own
# subpath, `shapeConfig`, and the root document it documents does not carry that
# object at all -- so a reader hunting `shapeConfig` inside the root document
# would have reported the size of every machine as unknown, forever, and blamed
# the service for it.
#
# The cost is one round trip per key instead of one for all of them, over a
# link-local address, and it is bounded twice: each read carries its own ceiling,
# and the first read decides whether there is a service to talk to at all. On a
# machine that is not an OCI instance nothing after that first read is attempted.
#
# NEVER FATAL, AND NEVER SLOW, ON ANY PATH
#
# This runs inside `Prepare environment`, which is the one retried step in the
# job. A diagnostic that can fail that step would cost a whole run to say
# something about the hardware, so every read here is allowed to fail and each
# failure is written down in the record instead: a runner that is not an OCI
# instance, or one whose metadata service does not answer, produces an `imds
# unreachable` line and an exit status of 0. The script therefore sets no
# errexit; `set -u` stays, since an unset variable here is a bug in this file
# rather than a fact about the runner.
#
# Exiting zero is not enough on its own, because a read that never returns costs
# the step its whole budget without ever reaching that exit. So every read here is
# taken through a wall-clock ceiling, which is the same rule hack/cozyreport.sh
# holds for the host commands it runs, and for the same reason: `lscpu` walks
# sysfs, and a machine wedged enough to be worth identifying is one where that walk
# can block. The metadata reads carry curl's own ceiling; the local ones are
# wrapped in `timeout`.
#
# With one stated exception, taken from the same collector: where `timeout` is not
# on PATH the local reads run unbounded rather than not at all, because a machine
# with no `timeout` is a missing dependency here and not a fact about the runner,
# and refusing to collect would trade the whole record for it. The record says so
# in a `[bounds]` line, so a reader is never left to infer which of the two a
# missing value was.
#
# Environment:
#   COZY_RUNNER_IDENTITY_FILE   where the record is written (default
#                               `_out/runner-identity.txt`, relative to the
#                               caller's cwd). hack/cozyreport.sh reads the same
#                               default from inside the sandbox container, where
#                               the repository root is /workspace; changing it
#                               here only means the report folds in nothing. On the
#                               CI path packages/core/testing/Makefile SETS this
#                               rather than deferring to an inherited value,
#                               because the record has to land inside the tree that
#                               is copied into the container: a path outside it
#                               would be written and then never carried in. The
#                               knob is for the report side and for tests.
#   COZY_RUNNER_IMDS_TIMEOUT    curl's own ceiling on each metadata read, in
#                               seconds (default 5). A malformed value falls back
#                               to the default and the record says which value it
#                               used. Zero is malformed for this knob rather than
#                               meaning "no wait": `--max-time 0` removes the
#                               ceiling outright, the same way a zero passed to
#                               `timeout` disables it rather than firing at once.
#   E2E_RUNNER_IDENTITY_LIB     set to define the helpers and return without
#                               reading anything or writing anything, so the unit
#                               suite can exercise them directly.

#
# Numbers only, and that is the rule rather than a shortlist of key names. A
# shortlist is the obvious way to write this and has a failure mode worth
# avoiding: the sizing keys have been renamed upstream before, and a list that
# stops matching reports the size of the machine as unknown on every run, quietly.
# Reading whatever the object holds keeps that visible, and keeping only its
# numbers is what stops the rule from being an argument about whatever Oracle may
# add to this object later -- a size is a number, an identifier is a string.
#
# Read with awk rather than with jq, because jq is not part of the runner image
# contract and a missing dependency here would report a machine of unknown size
# while the service was answering fine.

# A regex is shorter and gets two things wrong that a test in this suite pins: a
# number inside a string value is not a number this object published, and a key one
# level down is not a key of this object -- it would arrive in the record under the
# sizing prefix as a measurement of something else.
#
# What the walk requires of its input, and what it does with the rest, because
# neither is obvious from the code and both decide what a reader may believe:
#
#   * The answer must be ONE complete JSON object: `{` first, `}` last, and the
#     braces balancing back to zero only at the last character. Anything else is
#     refused whole rather than read in part, which covers a body cut off in
#     transit, a top-level array, and two objects glued together -- in each case
#     keys this object never published would otherwise arrive under the sizing
#     prefix as though it had.
#   * A KEY is kept only if it is shaped like a field name AND is short enough to
#     be one. This object's keys are `ocpus`, `memoryInGBs` and their like; a
#     service answering something else has its key text refused for the same reason
#     a per-key scalar answer is, since a key is printed into the record just as a
#     value is -- an identifier, a newline that would forge a line of its own, or a
#     twenty-thousand-character run all arrive on the key side.
#   * A repeated key prints once per occurrence. Nothing here dedupes, and the
#     record showing a key twice is the service having sent it twice.
