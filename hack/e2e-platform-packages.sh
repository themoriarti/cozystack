# Container-mode Talos shares the runner kernel and cannot load DRBD. Keep the
# normal package graph for QEMU, and let that lane replace two Packages instead:
# LINSTOR, otherwise identical with its logger sidecar disabled, and kubevirt-cdi,
# which is NOT identical -- it raises the importer memory limit from CDI's 600M
# to 4Gi and the request from 60M to 256Mi, for the reason stated above that
# override below.
#
# The consequence is worth stating where it is made, and it applies to both:
# the merge-gating lane exercises neither the shipped CDI default nor
# `drbd.enabled: true`. Whether a tenant worker disk imports at 600M, and
# whether the DRBD path works at all, are answered by the QEMU lanes
# (nightly.yaml, e2e-tag.yaml), which take no override, and not here.

# CDI's own 600M ceiling was seen to OOM the decompress+convert of a tenant
# worker disk near 100% on this lane, after which CDI retries from scratch and
# the DataVolume cycles forever instead of failing. It is an override here and
# not a chart default because the same import completes at 600M on a QEMU-node
# cluster, so what has been shown to need the headroom is this substrate, not
# the product. Move it into packages/system/kubevirt-cdi/values.yaml the day it
# reproduces somewhere that is not a container lane.
