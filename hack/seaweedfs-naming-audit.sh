# SeaweedFS 4.31 rename — fleet audit (READ-ONLY).
#
# Classifies every SeaweedFS tenant into the three states the chart's naming guard
# (packages/system/seaweedfs/templates/naming-guard.yaml) decides between:
#
#   L      exactly the chart-named generation -> the upgrade adopts it. Nothing to do.
#   S      exactly the release-named generation -> re-bind first (runbook Step 2).
#   MIXED  both generations -> the chart REFUSES; an operator must remove the empty one.
#
# For MIXED it also reports which generation is ORIGINAL, from durable evidence:
#
#   sh.helm.release.v1.<name>-system.v1  — the manifest of revision 1 names either
#       seaweedfs-master (born pre-4.31) or <release>-master (born 4.31). Exact, but
#       revision 1 may have been pruned by Helm's history limit.
#   PersistentVolume creation timestamps — the original generation's PVs predate the
#       duplicate's, which were provisioned later by the bad upgrade. Compared only
#       against each other (see the relative rule below); info.first_deployed is
#       printed as context but decides nothing.
#
# PV timestamps, not PVC ones: runbook Step 2 deletes each release-named claim and
# recreates it under the chart name against the SAME PV, so claim age is not durable
# and inverts for a tenant interrupted mid-re-bind. The PV survives and keeps its
# creationTimestamp.
#
# Direction is decided by a RELATIVE rule, never a clock window: a generation is
# the candidate duplicate only when EVERY one of its bound PVs is strictly newer
# than every bound PV of the other generation — the same precondition runbook
# Step 2a enforces before deleting anything. Overlapping vintages mean an
# interrupted Step 2 re-bind (both generations on original PVs) or interleaved
# provisioning, and the audit refuses to name a candidate. An absolute window
# measured from first_deployed was tried first and is unsound: the shipped
# StorageClasses are WaitForFirstConsumer, so PVs appear at pod-SCHEDULE time,
# and ordinary cold-cluster latency puts even the original generation's PVs
# minutes past first_deployed — which pushed a mid-rebind tenant into the branch
# whose advice deletes the un-re-bound claims.
#
# IMPORTANT — what this does NOT tell you. "Which generation is original" is not
# "the other one is empty". A duplicate that never scheduled (safe to delete) and one
# that served writes and later crashed (holds unique objects) are identical on every
# durable signal — same revision-1 scheme, same first_deployed deltas. Establishing
# emptiness needs the duplicate's volume files and the filer's volume list, which this
# script does not inspect. It narrows the question; it does not answer it.
#
# Usage:  hack/seaweedfs-naming-audit.sh [namespace...]
#         KUBECONFIG=<file> hack/seaweedfs-naming-audit.sh
# Exit:   0        the audit RAN TO COMPLETION; the table is the whole answer
#                  (an empty table then means a genuinely clean fleet).
#         non-zero a kubectl query FAILED, so the audit is INCOMPLETE and the
#                  table must NOT be trusted -- a message naming the failed query
#                  is on stderr. This is fail-CLOSED by design (see run_kubectl):
#                  the output gates a destructive runbook step, so an unreachable
#                  API aborts loudly rather than printing an empty table that
#                  reads identically to "nothing to do".
# Nothing is ever mutated on either path -- every kubectl call is read-only.
#
# POSIX sh, deliberately. hack/seaweedfs-naming-audit.bats sources this file, and
# cozytest.sh sources the converted test into its own /bin/sh — which is dash on
# the CI runner. A bash shebang would not save it: `.` runs the file's contents in
# the caller's shell and the shebang is just a comment. Keeping the script POSIX
# is what makes the tested shell and the executed shell the same one; anything
# bash-only here is untested in CI and unavailable at run time. `pipefail` in
# particular is not POSIX and dash 0.5.12 (Ubuntu) rejects it outright.

# run_kubectl <what> <kubectl-args...> -- run ONE read-only kubectl query

# a destructive runbook step (deleting a tenant's PVCs), so a query that FAILS
# must never be mistaken for a query that found nothing: an enumerating LIST
# returns empty stdout on a timeout or an RBAC denial, byte-identical to the same
# LIST succeeding on a genuinely clean fleet, and the old `2>/dev/null` on each
# call turned an unreachable API into a silent false "nothing to do". Every
# enumeration is routed through here so any failure is loud and terminal instead.
#
# On success prints kubectl's stdout verbatim -- which may legitimately be empty,
# because a LIST that matched nothing is honestly clean; keeping that case
# distinct from failure is the whole point. On a non-zero exit prints the failed
# query to stderr and returns that exit code; kubectl's own stderr stays on fd 2
# and reaches the operator unfiltered. Callers MUST propagate the non-zero status
# (`|| return`/`|| exit`) -- a bare `for x in $(run_kubectl ...)` would swallow
# it, because a for-loop ignores the exit status of its word-list command, and an

#
# This is a by-NAME GET, but it is NOT best-effort: system_releases decides whether
# a release IS SeaweedFS from the result, so a swallowed failure silently drops a
# real tenant -- the false-clean this script exists to prevent. EXISTENCE and
# EXTRACTION are therefore two separate questions, because `--ignore-not-found
# -o jsonpath` cannot tell them apart (it returns empty + exit 0 both for an absent
# Secret AND for a present Secret whose .data.release is missing):

#      timeout, apiserver down) stays non-zero and run_kubectl makes it fatal.
#   2. The Secret EXISTS, so its payload MUST decode. A helm.sh/release.v1 Secret
#      with no .data.release, a payload that is not base64(base64(gzip(...))), or an
#      empty JSON after decoding is CORRUPT state, not an absence -- and here that

# moment ago, so a NotFound now is a mid-audit deletion race, and failing closed on

      #     spell chart.metadata.name sits LATER in the payload -- and a greedy
      #     `sed 's/.*"chart"...'` would return that decoy instead of the real
      #     chart. A wrong name reads downstream as "not SeaweedFS" and drops a
      #     real release from the report: the exact silent false-clean this guard
      #     exists to stop. `grep -o | head -1` takes the leftmost match.
      #   * The chart -> metadata -> name key path stays ADJACENT. A looser "any
      #     'name' after 'metadata'" matches chart.templates[].name, which Helm
      #     serializes immediately after metadata on EVERY healthy release, so it
      #     would return a template path for every tenant.

# corruption and is NOT fatal -- because the consequence differs. When release_json
# returns empty for a present Secret the tenant is dropped from the report: a
# false-clean. When pv_epoch returns "" the claim merely contributes no epoch,
# which marks its whole generation INCOMPLETE (see audit_ns) and forces the safe
# "direction cannot be established -> classify by hand" branch. That degradation is
# conservative by construction: it never yields a false-clean and never names a

#   * PVC .spec.volumeName empty -- a Pending / unbound claim, a routine state;
#   * PV .metadata.creationTimestamp empty -- shouldn't happen (the apiserver always
#     stamps it), but if it ever did the only effect is one missing epoch, i.e. the

# `--ignore-not-found` keeps a genuinely-absent PVC/PV (NotFound) on that same
