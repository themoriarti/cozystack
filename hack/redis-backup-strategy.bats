# Behavioural tests for the shipped Redis backup/restore strategy script,
# extracted from the rendered cozy-default-redis Strategy CR and EXECUTED with
# stubbed redis-cli / curl. helm-unittest (tests/strategy_redis_test.yaml) pins
# the chart's render-time decisions (volumes, env, deadline); the script's own
# behaviour — which mode reaches which command — is a contract between the
# running Pod, Redis and S3, so it is exercised here rather than string-matched.
#
# The load-bearing case is cleanup: a deleted Backup renders MODE=cleanup, and
# it must delete the object and NEVER reach the restore path's FLUSHALL against
# the live master. Blanking the object key or breaking the rfs-redis- sentinel
# prefix is caught the same way — by what the stubs are actually called with.
#
# Run via hack/cozytest.sh from the repo root (make bats-unit-tests); relative
# paths resolve against that cwd. Each @test builds its own fixture; a
# load-bearing assertion is never the last line (cozytest.sh rewrites a lone
# `}` into `return 0` + `}`, which would swallow the final command's status).
#
# The rendered script is run with `bash`, not `sh`: it opens `set -euo
# pipefail`, which the production image's busybox ash supports but the CI
# runner's /bin/sh (dash) rejects at line 1. bash matches ash's pipefail
# semantics; same reason hack/migration-50-etcd-adopt.bats runs its script
# with bash.

# controller-render placeholders (Mode, Release.Name, ObjectKey) with the given
# values ($2 mode, $3 app, $4 object key), and rebind every absolute path it
# touches into $5 so it runs unprivileged. An empty render is an early failure,
# and no real /etc or /tmp path may survive the rebinding — these tests EXECUTE
# the script.
