# Unit tests for the probe-output resolver in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/etcd-probe.sh.
#
# The etcd suite proves the member Pods serve Prometheus metrics over plaintext
# http by running a throwaway curl Pod and reading back a `code=<status>` marker.
# `kubectl run --attach` is how that marker comes back, and it loses the stream
# of a container that exits before the attach connection is established -- curl
# against a Pod IP finishes in milliseconds, so the loss is routine rather than
# exotic. When it happens the
# caller sees only kubectl's own chatter ("If you don't see a command prompt,
# try pressing enter."), reads no marker, and reports the metrics endpoint as
# broken -- a false negative on a healthy cluster.
#
# etcd_probe_resolve is the recovery: the container's stdout is still on disk in
# the Pod's log, so a lost attach stream is re-read rather than believed. These
# tests pin that recovery, the pass-through when attach did carry the marker,
# and the honest surfacing of a genuine non-200 (which must NOT be masked by the
# fallback -- a real failure has to stay a failure).
#
# The resolver is separated from the kubectl orchestration precisely so it can
# be tested without a cluster; the `kubectl run`/`kubectl logs` calls around it
# need a live cluster and are covered by the e2e run, matching how the other
# hack/ helpers are tested.
#
# CI runs this file under Bats through `make bats-unit-tests`. It also remains
# compatible with the legacy `hack/cozytest.sh` translator, whose awk parser
# recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its own line. The tests avoid
# `run`, `$status`, setup(), and teardown() for that compatibility path and use
# direct shell assertions. Titles remain distinguishable after stripping all
# but [A-Za-z0-9], as required by the legacy translator.
#
# Run with: bats hack/etcd-probe_test.bats
