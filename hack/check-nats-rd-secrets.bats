# Unit test: the nats trust anchor reaches tenants as a key-free projection, and
# the two key-BEARING Secrets the chart creates never do.
#
# The chart issues nats-<name>-ca (CA certificate AND CA private key, the latter
# under tls.key) and nats-<name>-tls (server certificate AND server private key).
# Neither may be handed to a tenant: read access to the CA key would let the
# holder issue certificates for anything rather than merely verify the server.
#
# What a client actually needs is ca.crt alone. That is delivered by the
# CA-extraction controller as the key-free <release>.tenant-ca projection,
# selected here by LABEL rather than by name. The label is stamped only on an
# object the controller itself produced, whereas a name grant conveys whatever
# happens to occupy the name.
#
# These assertions exist because both halves are one edit away from breaking
# with a fully green chart suite, for two different reasons. The
# ResourceDefinition is rendered, by the nats-rd chart inlining cozyrds/*, but
# that chart carries neither a tests directory nor the test target
# hack/helm-unit-tests.sh looks for.
# The dashboard Role is rendered by a chart that has both, and no suite under
# packages/apps/nats/tests/ asserts on it.
#
# The grants are asserted as WHITELISTS against rendered output rather than as
# a blacklist of forbidden names over source text. A blacklist grepping for
# "{{ .Release.Name }}-ca" is defeated by quoting the scalar, by $.Release.Name,
# or by a fullname helper -- all of which grant the CA private key while the
# guard stays green.
