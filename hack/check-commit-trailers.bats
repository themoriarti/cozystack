# Unit tests for hack/check-commit-trailers.sh.
#
# Each test builds a throwaway git repository, writes commits with the message
# shape under test, and runs the checker over base..HEAD — the same range shape
# the workflow computes from the merge base. Real commits rather than a canned
# list, because merge commits and the trailer block are git's behaviour, not the
# checker's.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run` or `$status`. Assertions are direct shell
# tests, and an expected failure is written as `if CHECK ...; then ... exit 1`.
# Each test runs in its own subshell, so the `cd` into the fixture does not leak.
