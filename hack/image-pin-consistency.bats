# Asserts that no first-party image repository is pinned at more than one
# digest across the committed tree.
#
# Promotion retags by digest: hack/promote-retag.sh copies every collected
# <repo>@<digest> to <repo>:<stable-version>. Two different digests under one
# repository therefore produce two copies competing for the same destination
# tag. The first wins, the second hits the write-once guard, and the promotion
# fails — on release day, in a workflow that runs once per release.
#
# This is not hypothetical. platform-migrations was pinned twice: once in
# packages/core/platform/values.yaml (stamped by its Makefile) and once as
# .backupStrategyController.chBackupClientImage, which had no producer at all
# and so froze at v1.4.0-rc.2 while the other advanced to v1.5.0. v1.6.0 is the
# first release cut through the promote path rather than a full rebuild, so it
# would have been the first to hit it.
#
# The general invariant is cheaper to hold than the specific one: a duplicate
# pin can arise from any package reusing another's image, which the tree does
# deliberately (backupstrategy-controller reuses platform-migrations as a
# curl+jq runner rather than shipping a second one-binary tag).
#
# Harness compatibility note: CI runs this file under Bats through
# `make bats-unit-tests`. It also remains compatible with the narrower legacy
# `hack/cozytest.sh` translator, so it avoids `run`, `$status`, `$output`,
# `skip`, and setup()/teardown(). Paths stay repo-root-relative for both
# runners.
#
# Run with: bats hack/image-pin-consistency.bats
