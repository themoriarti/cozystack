# Ties the kubernetes-nodes chart's default Talos image to the kubernetes-worker-image
# catalog's default golden. The two live in independently edited files:
#
#   packages/apps/kubernetes-nodes/values.yaml      talos.{schematicID,version}
#   packages/system/kubernetes-worker-image/values.yaml   images[], storageClass
#
# A worker pool that opts in with `osImage.builtin: {}` resolves the golden it
# clones from the POOL chart's talos defaults, then requires the catalog to hold a
# matching (schematicID, version) — packages/apps/kubernetes-nodes/templates/
# nodegroup.yaml fails the whole render when it does not. So a one-sided Talos bump
# silently breaks every fresh install using osImage.builtin, and nothing catches it
# until a ~95-minute e2e run does.
#
# The StorageClass is the same trap from the other direction: CDI cannot
# CSI-clone across StorageClasses (it would silently fall back to a host-assisted
# copy over the pod network), so the render also rejects a group whose
# storageClass differs from its golden's. Bumping one file's default alone brings
# that guard down on the default path.
#
# Both checks are cheap and exact, which is the point — they turn a slow, remote
# e2e failure into a local one-second unit test.
#
# Compatible with both `bats` directly and the in-repo cozytest.sh runner, which
# runs each @test in a fresh subshell with `set -u` and does not honor bats
# setup()/teardown().

# Second family of default-drift guards on the same chart: the Talos <-> Kubernetes
# support matrix. The render guard keyed only on `talos.version`, so a pool could
# reach a different Talos release through `osImage.builtin.version` /
# `osImage.factory.version` and boot a kubelet outside its support window with no
# render failure. The table now lives once in templates/_helpers.tpl and both
# paths consult it.
#
# The symmetry is structural, not observable from a render: the matrix ships one
# row (`v1.13`) whose Kubernetes list is a superset of `values.schema.json`'s
# `version` enum, so no schema-valid pairing can make either call site fail today.
# A helm-unittest case would have to put an out-of-enum `version` in, and
# helm-unittest validates the schema, so it cannot. These two guards cover what a
# render cannot: that both call sites exist, and that the table still means
# something for the defaults the chart ships.

# chart's `make update` copies files/versions.yaml and images/kubectl.tag from
# the parent and not the talos block, so a one-sided bump leaves the parent's
# support-matrix guard reasoning about one Talos release while every worker boots
# another — and the catalog check above would go on passing, because it only ever
# reads one of the two files.
