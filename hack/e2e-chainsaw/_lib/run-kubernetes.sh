# kubectl_wait_retry: wraps `kubectl wait` with retries against transient
# management-cluster apiserver/etcd errors.
#
# The e2e sandbox is a 3-node kind cluster on Talos VMs; the 3-instance
# etcd HA cluster can shed a leader under the accumulated CDI+DRBD IO +
# multiple back-to-back Kamaji tenant control-plane bringups this suite
# stacks. kubectl's watch-based `wait` exits non-zero on the FIRST server
# error it sees on the channel, even when the target is on the cusp of
# becoming Ready. Concretely, we have seen:
#   Error from server: etcdserver: leader changed
# fire mid-wait for `kubernetes-<test>-{cluster-autoscaler,kccm,kcsi-controller,base}`
# with 3 of 4 deployments already `condition met` and the 4th ~200ms
# from Ready. The snapshot-on-fail collector then showed all four at
# `readyReplicas: 2` — the wait exited early, not the target's fault.
#
# This wrapper retries a small number of times against a curated allowlist
# of transient server-side signatures. It does NOT swallow legitimate
# timeouts (`--timeout=... expired`) or NotFound; those still surface.

# the previous tenant has not yet vacated -> memory starvation -> a worker VM
# misses the node-join budget and the test flakes on worker-node-join.

# disabled (see the Tenant in hack/e2e-install-cozystack.bats), so it carries no
# baseline PVCs, and the e2e apps run sequentially each cleaning up after
# itself; at cleanup time the only VMs/VMIs/PVCs in the namespace belong to the

# 28751310913, LINSTOR satellite ErrorReport 6A4AADFD-349B2-000000):
# tearing down a tenant Kubernetes worker with a `replicated` (autoPlace=3,
# DRBD) 20 GiB root disk removes the PVC from the API within seconds, but
# the ZFS `zvol destroy` on each satellite lags behind by tens of seconds

# not on the physical satellite space return; if the next tenant test
# starts inside that window it hits `zfs create -V ...` failing with
# `cannot create '...': out of space`, LINSTOR-CSI then retries autoplace,
# each retry racing the still-being-torn-down previous placement and

# B1 regression coverage (PR #2872 review). The tenant's default StorageClass
# must be chosen among the *propagated* classes and must never be the legacy
# "kubevirt" alias -- even when the management cluster exposes only remote
# LINSTOR classes whose names sort alphabetically after "kubevirt" and none is
# named the configured storageClass (default "replicated"). That is the
# feature's own multi-tier target configuration. A regressed `sortAlpha | first`
# over a candidate set that still contained the inserted "kubevirt" alias would
# pick it, pointing the tenant default at an infra class absent on the
# management cluster -> default PVCs stay Pending with no error surfaced.
#
# helm-unittest cannot reach this branch: with no live cluster Helm `lookup`
# returns empty, so the storageClasses map always collapses to the "replicated"
# fallback (see packages/apps/kubernetes/tests/csi_test.yaml). It is therefore
# exercised here against the live management cluster with a single server-side
# dry-run render (helm v4 executes `lookup` against the API): add two remote
# LINSTOR classes that sort after "kubevirt", remove "replicated" for the one
# render, restore it immediately, then assert on the rendered -csi HelmRelease's
# storageClasses map.
