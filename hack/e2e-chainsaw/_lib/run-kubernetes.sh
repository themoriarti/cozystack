#
# The bit it reads is `ready` on the init container. This sidecar is built with
# no probes at all, and kubelet's UpdatePodStatus sets `ready = !exists` for a
# container with no readiness worker once it is running -- liveness is not an
# input to readiness anywhere. So the bit is exactly "the container is
# running", and false means not running: never-started, waiting between
# restarts, or already-terminated. Running-but-not-ready is not a shape this
# container can hold, which is why the taxonomy below does not claim it.
# Those are not one finding: the hang starts the container and then fails it,
# so with restartPolicy Always it settles into CrashLoopBackOff and passes
# through Error, while a superseded virt-launcher from a VM restart exits
# cleanly and terminates Completed. ContainerState is a union, so a waiting
# reason alone leaves the terminated case blank and cannot tell the two apart.
# Both reasons are carried so each shape arrives labelled.
#
# Even so this line points rather than concludes, and it says so out loud: the
# bit cannot separate every shape, the describe that follows can, and a
# headline that asserts more than the bit carries is the same mislabel this

# Capture each tenant worker's guest serial console from the management
# cluster. When a node group sets logSerialConsole, KubeVirt streams the
# console into a guest-console-log container beside virt-launcher, and reading
# it needs nothing from inside the guest: no talosctl, no client certificate,
# no helper Pod, no reachable apid. That is the whole reason it exists. The
# talosctl capture below can only describe a worker whose apid already answers,
# so a worker that stalls earlier -- the case where no Node registers and no
# certificate request is ever made -- is invisible to it by construction, and
# the console is the only remaining surface.
#
# Reads start at the beginning of the stream rather than tailing it, because a
# guest that repaints its console would push the boot output out of any tail
# window while --limit-bytes truncates from the far end instead. That covers
# only what kubectl returns: whatever the kubelet has already rotated out of
# the container log (containerLogMaxSize, 10Mi x 5 by default) is gone before
# the capture runs, and no read option recovers it.
#
# An absent guest-console-log container is the finding, not a gap: it says
# console logging did not take effect on this run, which is a different fact
# from a guest that printed nothing. kubectl's refusal is kept beside the
# capture rather than inside it so the two stay distinguishable, and the
# capture file says which of them happened.
#
# The Pod list is namespace-wide rather than scoped to one release. The two
# virt-launcher captures immediately above the call site already select that
# way, and suites run one at a time. Below the cap a Pod that does not belong
# to this test costs one extra file named after itself and nothing else; at
# the cap it can displace one of this suite's own, since kubectl returns the
# list name-sorted. COLLECTION-TRUNCATED.txt is what keeps that visible.

#
# The throttled counters alone say a container hit some ceiling, not which one,
# and a VM capped at one core and a VM capped at eight are the same number
# without the quota beside them. Nor do they say what the container got: being
# stopped at a ceiling and never being scheduled onto a physical CPU are
# different failures that both leave throttled periods behind, and the usage
# counter is the only one of the six that separates them. It costs a wider
# filter rather than another read, since cAdvisor puts it on the stream this
# capture already fetches.
#
# Four of the six are gated, and on the same condition. cAdvisor emits the
# quota series and all three CFS counters only for a container whose quota is
# non-zero; container_spec_cpu_period and container_cpu_usage_seconds_total are
# the two it emits for any container with a CPU spec at all. So a container
# that reports anything puts two shapes on the wire and no third: all six when
# it is capped, the period and the usage when it is not. (A container cAdvisor
# knows nothing about contributes none of them, and reaches this capture as the
# same silence as a node with no worker on it.) The second is a reading rather
# than a gap -- it is the question this collector was added to answer, and it
# arrives without being computed.
#
# Worth stating because a short capture is also what a truncated read looks
# like, and this function spends its whole length making that difference legible.
# A reader who expected six families and found two would reach for the wrong
# conclusion with the artifact agreeing.
#
# Read from the kubelet rather than from inside the container on purpose. A
# reader that runs inside the container shares the cgroup it is measuring, so
# it slows down exactly when the answer matters and needs a budget sized for
# the pathological case; the kubelet is outside that cgroup and is not subject
# to it. It also removes any dependency on what the container image happens to
# ship and on how the host lays cgroups out, since cAdvisor reports the same
# series under either cgroup version.
#
# The in-container reading does exist in this tree -- hack/e2e-capture-dataplane.sh
# reads cpu.stat straight out of the ovs-ovn container -- and the size difference
# between the two is the two paragraphs above, not the reading itself. That one
# has a container it may assume (its own image, one namespace, one workload) and
# a caller that already knows the Pod. This one is handed a node and has to find
# the workers, tell a kubelet that never answered from a node carrying none, and
# survive a filter that fails half way, because the whole point is to be believed
# when it reports nothing.
#
# Takes the sample number it is writing, because it is called twice: the
# counters are cumulative since the container started, so one reading gives an
# average over the whole uptime and no reading of the failure window. Two
# readings a fixed interval apart give a rate, and a rate is what the burst
# profile needs -- a guest that freezes for tens of seconds and then runs at its
# ceiling produces a low average and a high instantaneous figure, and only the
# second of those distinguishes it from a guest that is simply capped.

# Read each sandbox node's own CPU accounting, straight from its kernel.
#
# The captures above are about the tenant worker's cgroup: what it was allowed
# and what it got. Neither can see the layer under the sandbox. A worker whose
# vCPU thread is runnable and simply not scheduled looks, from the cgroup, like
# a worker that asked for nothing -- and the two candidate explanations for that
# are a sandbox node oversubscribed from inside and a sandbox node not given its
# own turn by the machine running the runner. Only the second leaves a trace,
# and it leaves it here: `steal` counts the time this kernel was runnable while
# the hypervisor beneath it ran somebody else.
#
# There is no kubelet or cAdvisor route to it. The kubelet's cAdvisor and
# summary endpoints publish container and node utilisation and neither carries a
# steal column, which cost one measurement window already; the node's own
# /proc/stat is the only surface with the number. crust-gather's node-shell Pod
# is refused by PodSecurity in this cluster, so the Talos API is what remains,
# and it is already how the report reaches these nodes for dmesg.
#
# Captured verbatim rather than reduced to a percentage, and the column legend
# is written beside it rather than folded into arithmetic here. In /proc/stat's
# cpu rows the eighth number after the label is steal and the ninth is guest,
# guest is enormous on a node running VMs and is already counted inside user,
# and reading the ninth as the eighth turns a fraction of a percent into
# twenty-odd. The legend states which is which where the numbers are, so the
# next reader does not repeat that.

# The rejection names no unit, because three of its four callers are seconds and the
# fourth is a Pod count: telling someone their importer cap must be "integer seconds"
# describes the wrong quantity, and the whole point of these notes is that they say
# something true about what was seen.
#
# Every knob below is pasted somewhere that accepts digits and nothing else, and
# each fails differently and quietly:
#
#   COZY_DIAG_PHASE_BUDGET=8m  -- goes into $(( )) inside cozy_diag_phase_start,
#     which is the FIRST statement of the diagnostics block. The arithmetic error
#     unwinds the whole function before its own headline, so the failing run
#     produces no diagnostics at all, only the shell's complaint. The worst
#     outcome on this path, arrived at through a knob.
#   COZY_DIAG_READ_TIMEOUT=2m  -- becomes --request-timeout=2ms and every read
#     fails instantly, so every note blames the cluster for a value.
#   COZY_DIAG_MAX_IMPORTERS=3s -- `[ n -gt 3s ]` exits 2, the `if` reads false and
#     the cap silently stops existing, which is the term this block capped on
#     purpose.
#
# A leading zero is rejected along with a suffix, and it is the arm that is easy to
# leave out. `0480` is all digits, so a digits-only check passes it through, and
# then `$(( ))` reads it as octal and fails exactly as `8m` does -- same total loss
# of the block, one character less obvious. For the read bound the same value is
# quieter and worse: `timeout -k 5 0480` is 480 seconds, so the per-call bound this
# whole change exists to add would be 24 times wider than the number says.
#
# Rejecting and naming the fallback is what the rest of this tree does with its own
# knobs, including this arm: hack/e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh rejects a zero or
# leading-zero COZY_PREVLOG_TAIL for the same octal reason, and
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md records that contract.
# A fourth argument, any non-empty value, rejects zero as well; it is a flag rather
# than a bound, and the call site spells it `positive`. Zero is all digits and
# passes every check above, and `timeout -k 5 0` disables the timeout outright while
# `--request-timeout=0s` means "no timeout" to kubectl -- the defect this change
# exists to remove, reachable through the knob it adds. The phase budget must keep
# accepting zero: the suite uses it to mean "already spent".
#
# A fifth argument replaces the parenthetical that says why zero is refused, and it
# exists because the flag now has more than one caller and they refuse zero for
# different reasons. For a bound, zero removes the ceiling. For the sampling
# interval it removes nothing and leaves two readings taken at the same instant --
# a pair that looks collected and divides to nothing. One sentence covering both

# The wait between the two passes over the counters that only mean something as
# a pair. Every counter those two collectors read is cumulative, so a single
# reading divides out to an average over the container's whole uptime and says
# nothing about the window the deadline covered; the difference between two
# readings does.
#
# It is the WAIT and not the interval those readings span: each pass also walks
# its nodes, and the other subject's pass falls between a subject's two
# readings. The captures stamp themselves for that reason, and a rate is
# computed from the stamps rather than from this number.
#
# Short on purpose, and this is the one number here chosen for what it measures
# rather than for what it costs. The profile being separated is a guest that
# freezes for tens of seconds and then runs flat out, and a window long enough
# to contain both halves averages them back into the figure that could not tell
# them apart in the first place. A window of this size lands inside one half or
# the other, which is what makes the pair a discriminator rather than a second
# copy of the average.
#
# It is also the whole wall-clock cost this pair adds to a failing run, since
# the two collectors share it: both take their first reading, the interval
# passes once, and both take their second.

# Lowered from 480 when the guest-Talos walk grew the service list and the link
# table. That collector is the `largest` term of the inequality below, the
# inequality had ten seconds of slack, and the two reads cost sixty across the
# minimum pool -- so the budget is what had to give. 420 rather than the 430 the
# arithmetic allows, because the guard compares the comment in both
# kubernetes-*/chainsaw-test.yaml against whole minutes, and a budget that is
# not one leaves that comment rounded rather than true.
#
# What that leaves is ten seconds, and it is worth knowing here rather than
# after the fact: the next collector added to the guest-Talos walk does not fit
# without re-deriving this number, because that walk is the `largest` term and
# ten seconds buys no bounded read at any bound this file uses. Adding one means
# lowering the budget again, and the paragraphs below are what that costs. The
# same arithmetic bounds the host-side walk, which is why a collector added
# there is priced against this number too rather than against the phase budget
# alone.
#
# What it costs is worth stating where the number is, not only in the change
# that moved it, and it is two costs rather than one.
#
# A shorter budget declines more, and what it declines first is what is gated
# last -- ghcr_mirror_diagnose and talos_image_cache_diagnose. Neither loses its
# subject entirely. The mirror's state is partly recoverable from the request
# counts and response durations the mirror capture records against its own log,
# and from the kube-system snapshot the host report takes; the image cache's
# re-probe has no substitute and is the collector this budget gives up first,
# which was already true at 480.
#
# The second cost lands on the guest captures rather than on the tail. One
# collector reads the node's metric stream ahead of the console: (d2) spends a
# listing plus one read per node -- up to 100s at the read bound and the
# three-node cap, a ceiling those numbers impose rather than a duration measured
# on a live cluster. Between that and the sixty seconds off the budget, the
# console and guest-Talos captures reach their gate with less left than before;
# they are still ahead of the tail in the order, so they are not first to go,
# but a run that was marginal for them is likelier to decline them now.
#
# What is deliberately NOT ahead of the console is the two-sample CPU pair,
# whose own ceiling is several times this one. What sits ahead of the console
# bounds what the console can lose, so that figure is the one to keep small; the
# ordering argument at the pair says the rest.
#
# That second read is not shared away in this change, and the reason is scope
# rather than merit -- the note at the read says why, and says that merging
# would improve both the cost and what a tight run collects.

# Wall-clock budget for the on-failure diagnostics phase as a whole, on top of the
# per-read bounds above, because the two buy different things. A per-read bound
# buys forward progress: one hung call can no longer eat the step. It does not buy
# an end to the phase, and the collectors on this path can together spend more than
# what is left of the op by the time it runs. Bounding every read and stopping
# there would have made the arithmetic in kubernetes-*/chainsaw-test.yaml legible
# and still false.
#
# So the phase is bounded as a phase. Once the budget is spent, the collectors that
# have not started are declined out loud instead of attempted, which keeps the one
# artifact that must survive reachable: the tenant crust-gather snapshot the
# caller's `exit 1` triggers.
#
# The budget is derived rather than chosen, from
#
#   budget + largest overshoot + snapshot <= op - bringup
#
# Every term but the budget belongs to something else: the op ceiling lives in both
# kubernetes-*/chainsaw-test.yaml, the snapshot's bound is on the crust-gather call
# above, and bringup is an observed figure rather than a ceiling. The overshoot
# term exists because admission gates when a collector may START, not when it ends,
# so one admitted a moment before the deadline still runs its whole cost. The
# default below is the largest whole minute under the bound that inequality gives.
# hack/run-kubernetes-node-join_test.bats holds the inequality against the code, so
# a later change cannot raise the budget past what the collectors leave room for.
#
# `largest` is a literal in that guard, taken from the heaviest collector at the
# pool's MINIMUM size, which makes it a floor and not a ceiling: the guest-Talos
# walk carries no cap, so a bigger pool makes that collector cost more than the
# figure the budget was derived against. Nor does it cover the collectors with no
# wall-clock bound at all. On the guest-Talos path the applies, waits and deletes
# carry `--request-timeout`/`--timeout`, which bounds one HTTP request rather than
# a client retrying against a wedged apiserver, and the image-cache re-probe makes
# unbounded calls of its own. Both are tracked in cozystack/cozystack#3666. So no
# worst case is claimed here, and none can be stated while that holds.
#
# What the budget buys, exactly and only, is that no collector is STARTED once it
# is spent, so the snapshot is never queued behind work begun past the deadline.
# That is how the snapshot was being lost.
#
# Admission is "the budget is not spent yet" rather than "this collector fits in
# what is left", and that is a choice. Sizing admission per collector would hold
# the phase to its budget exactly, and would also decline the guest-Talos capture
# on a merely slow run, throwing away the only in-guest evidence to protect a
# snapshot that was not yet in danger. Start-gating leaves that to the cheap-first
# order below, and the image-cache diagnosis is the collector this budget gives up
# first, which is worth knowing before its dumps are relied on.

  # artifact exists to let someone fix. Cheap reads first, then the collectors
  # that cost minutes. Everything ahead of this line is bounded reads and a capped
  # walk, which together fit inside the budget with room left, while the gated
  # collectors below can exhaust it between them on a slow run. Putting the
  # heavy ones first, as this block used to, spends the budget on them and
  # declines the two 25s reads that answer the question. The same rule decides
  # the order among the gated collectors themselves: each one's ceiling bounds
  # what everything after it can lose, so a collector goes above the console
  # only if its ceiling is small enough to be worth risking the console for.
  #
  # (d2) Worker network counters, first of the gated collectors and cheapest of
  # them: one listing and one read per node, four bounded reads against the
  # minutes every collector below can spend between them. Its answer also has no
  # other source in this artifact. What it settles is which side of the worker's image
  # pull is slow. The guest reports its own progress and cannot see the bytes
  # that never became progress, so a pull that keeps restarting and one that
  # crawls look identical from in there. The host side counts both, and the gap
  # between it and the guest's progress is the discriminator.
  #
  # WHICH ROW answers that is not obvious and getting it wrong inverts the
  # reading, so it is written here rather than left to the reader. cAdvisor
  # publishes one row per interface in the Pod's network namespace, and a
  # bridge-bound worker has four of them:
  #
  #   eth0      a DUMMY holding the Pod IP so the kubelet's check still passes.
  #             It carries no traffic, so its counters sit at zero -- and it is
  #             the row a reader reaches for first, by name, where zero reads as
  #             a worker that received nothing.
  #   eth0-nic  the Pod's real NIC, renamed and enslaved to the bridge. Its
  #             RECEIVE is what arrived from the cluster network, and that is
  #             the number this capture exists to produce.
  #   k6t-eth0  the bridge; the same bytes again as they cross it.
  #   tap0      the host side of the tap to the guest, whose counters are named
  #             from the host's end, so traffic toward the guest is its
  #             transmit rather than its receive.
  #
  # The filter deliberately carries no interface predicate: all four rows reach
  # the artifact so the reader can tell them apart, and dropping three of them

  # (d) What the workers got, what they were denied, and what the sandbox nodes

  # it, and whether it was ever scheduled at all, are recorded nowhere else,
  # while (b1) above and (b) below describe a guest that at least reports
  # something on its own. (a) shows a Running VMI on a healthy virt-launcher,
  # which is where mode 2a stops being the answer and the question becomes why a
  # healthy VM made no progress -- a node sitting at half its capacity does not
  # settle that, and these counters do.
  #
  # It sits BELOW the console, and its ceiling rather than its worth is the
  # reason. Each collector spends a listing plus up to three node reads per
  # sample, so the pair is sixteen bounded reads and one interval: at the read
  # bound and the three-node cap that is most of the phase budget on its own. In
  # practice it costs the interval plus a handful of reads that an apiserver or
  # an apid answering at all answers in under a second -- but the run where
  # those reads DO approach their bound is a wedged kubelet, which is the
  # failure this whole block is written for. So the ceiling is not a remote
  # case here, and a collector carrying one that large must not sit ahead of the
  # single capture that survives a worker which never reached apid: ahead of the
  # console it could take the console with it, and below it the worst it can
  # spend is its own time and the legs after it. The gate's promise is the same
  # either way and is worth stating, since it reads like a fit check and is not
  # one: it admits a collector whose start is inside the budget, so one admitted
  # late still runs to completion and overruns.
  #
  # That overrun is already budgeted for, and the number is worth putting here
  # because it is the first question this pair invites. The phase budget is
  # derived as budget + largest overshoot + snapshot <= op - bringup, where the
  # overshoot term is exactly "one collector admitted a moment before the
  # deadline runs its whole cost". This pair's ceiling is sixteen bounded reads
  # plus the interval; the term is the guest-Talos walk, which is larger. So a
  # pair admitted at the last second finishes inside the room already left for
  # the tenant crust-gather snapshot rather than pushing it past the op.
  # hack/run-kubernetes-node-join_test.bats holds that against both numbers, so
  # a later change to the cap, the read bound or the interval cannot quietly
  # make this pair the binding term.
  #
  # Both collectors are read twice with one wait between the passes, and the
  # wait is shared: the counters on both sides are cumulative, so one reading of
  # either is an average over an uptime rather than a rate over the failure.
  # Taking the first reading of both, waiting once, and taking the second of
  # both costs the wait once rather than twice.
  #
  # What the knob does NOT give is the interval either subject's counters span.
  # The worker's two readings are separated by the wait plus the sandbox pass
  # between them, the sandbox's by the wait plus the worker pass, and on the run
  # this exists for those passes are the slow part rather than the wait. So each
  # capture stamps the moment it was read and the reader subtracts stamps rather
  # than assuming the knob. The two subjects' windows overlap and are offset by
  # one pass; they are not identical, and treating them as identical is the
  # error the stamps remove.
  #
  # This `sleep` is not the fixed-timeout kind the e2e conventions rule out.

# B1 regression coverage (PR #2872 review). The tenant's default StorageClass
# must be chosen among the *propagated* classes and must never be the legacy
# "kubevirt" alias -- even when the management cluster exposes only remote
# LINSTOR classes whose names sort alphabetically after "kubevirt" and none is
# named the configured storageClass (default "replicated"). That is the
# feature's own multi-tier target configuration. A regressed `sortAlpha | first`
# over a candidate set that still contained the inserted "kubevirt" alias would
# pick it, pointing the tenant default at an infra class absent on the
# management cluster -> default PVCs stay Pending with no error surfaced.
#
# helm-unittest cannot reach this branch: with no live cluster Helm `lookup`
# returns empty, so the storageClasses map always collapses to the "replicated"
# fallback (see packages/apps/kubernetes/tests/csi_test.yaml). It is therefore
# exercised here against the live management cluster with a single server-side
# dry-run render (helm v4 executes `lookup` against the API): add two remote
# LINSTOR classes that sort after "kubevirt", remove "replicated" for the one
# render, restore it immediately, then assert on the rendered -csi HelmRelease's
