# Shared helper: choose the Talos Image Factory base URL for tenant Kubernetes
# e2e CRs.
#
# Prefer the in-sandbox caching mirror (hack/e2e-talos-image-cache.yaml, deployed
# by hack/e2e-install-cozystack.bats) when a worker's CDI importer can actually
# reach it, otherwise fall back to the chart default (the public factory.talos.dev)
# by emitting nothing. The mirror rides out the public factory's flaky/range-less
# egress that otherwise stalls worker DataVolume imports past the 12-minute
# node-join deadline — see cozystack/cozystack#3231. Falling back to the default
# means the mirror can only help, never make CI worse.
#
# Reachability is not assumed. Tenant namespaces run under a default-deny Cilium
# egress installed by the tenant chart: a worker's importer may reach the `world`
# entity (hence the public factory) and the tenant's own tree, but not an
# arbitrary kube-system Service. Without an explicit allow, the importer resolves
# talos-image-cache.kube-system.svc yet its TCP connect to the ClusterIP is
# silently dropped and the disk import never starts. This helper installs that
# allow (the CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy shipped in the mirror manifest) and
# then verifies the path end to end from a Pod that faces the exact same egress
# rules as a real importer, so the mirror is used only when it genuinely works.
#
# Root cause + fix are from cozystack/cozystack#3254 (@lexfrei), ported here to
# the Chainsaw layout (hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/).

# _talos_image_cache_deploy_state: answer "is the mirror Deployment there?" as

#
# --ignore-not-found is what makes a three-way answer possible: a genuine absence
# becomes exit 0 with no output, which leaves a non-zero exit meaning only "the
# question was never answered" — connection refused, Unauthorized, timed out.
# A plain `get` collapses those two into one exit code, and the caller below then
# reads a blip as an absence, caches it, and sends every tenant worker in the
# suite to the public factory over the live egress the mirror exists to avoid.
# Same idiom as the teardown poll in hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/etcd-cleanup.sh.
#
# talos_image_cache_diagnose asks the same question and answers it its own way,
# and the two are separate on purpose. That one runs on the node-join failure
# path under a phase budget, where re-asking spends what the crust-gather
# snapshot after it needs, and it gives up after one attempt. This one runs on
# the happy path, where a re-ask costs a suite nothing and buys it the mirror.
#
# The re-ask is small, and each attempt has to be bounded twice over for the
# re-ask to be worth anything. kubectl's --request-timeout defaults to 0 — no
# deadline on the request at all — and the case this loop exists for is a
# connection that establishes and then stalls, which client-go's dial timeout
# does not bound. The flag on its own is still not a wall-clock bound: against
# an unreachable apiserver kubectl retries discovery several times before it
# gives up, so a call carrying only the flag costs a multiple of it, which
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/pod-label-census.sh measured and sized its caller's op
# timeout around. Asking three times would inherit that multiple, inside a
# Chainsaw op the rest of the tenant test has to fit in. So each attempt takes
# both bounds, the pairing the reads in run-kubernetes.sh use and explain beside
# its pod list: --request-timeout bounds the HTTP request, timeout bounds the
# client retrying against a wedged apiserver. A kill by timeout exits non-zero
# and is simply another attempt that did not answer. Past that, an apiserver
# that is down does not become reachable by asking longer, and a run whose
# apiserver is down has bigger problems than which factory it pulls from. A
# real absence answers on the first try and waits for nothing.
#
# The wrapper is skipped rather than depended on when `timeout` is not installed,
# for the reason _talos_image_cache_bounded_read gives below and one more that is
# specific to a loop: its exit 127 would otherwise count as an attempt that did
# not answer, three times over, and a missing local binary would pin the whole
# suite to the public factory while every message blamed the apiserver.
#
# The outer bound sits ABOVE the inner one rather than level with it, and that
# gap is the whole reason kubectl ever gets to explain itself. Measured against a
# stub apiserver, the three ways this call fails are not alike. A refused port
# answers in under a second and names the refusal. One that completes TCP but
# stalls in TLS gets kubectl's own handshake deadline, which is shorter than
# either bound and fires twice inside the window, so there is text even though
# the wrapper ends up killing the call. A blackholed address — SYN dropped, no
# RST, which is what a wedged node or a netpol looks like — produces nothing at
# all until some deadline expires, and with the two bounds equal the expiry that
# arrives is the wall-clock kill, at the same instant as the request deadline it
# beats to it. `--request-timeout` then cannot fire in any of the three, which
# makes it decoration. Ten seconds of headroom hands that case back to kubectl:
# the request deadline ends the attempt and says why, and the wrapper stays as
# the backstop for a client that overruns its own deadline. The cost is ten more
# seconds per attempt on a path where the apiserver is already unreachable,
# against a 50m op.
#
# kubectl's stderr is therefore deliberately not swallowed: it is the only thing
# that separates refused from unauthorized from stalled, and suppressing it would
# replace one silent failure with another. It is still not guaranteed — a kill
# can always land before the client has said anything — so the last attempt's
# exit status is named too, in the vocabulary the diagnostic reads below use for
# 124 and 137. Between the two the caller's warning always has something real to
# point at.

  # "the call failed" are the same non-zero status -- `kubectl get` exits 1 for a
  # refused connection, for Unauthorized and for an unrecognised kind exactly as
  # it does for NotFound -- so a read that never reached the apiserver was
  # announced as "not deployed", a claim about the cluster drawn from a call that
  # failed to make one, and it retired the cache hypothesis on the one path that
  # exists to test it. With the flag, absent is exit 0 with empty output and
  # every other non-zero is unknown.

  # clock, but each call site interpolates the value itself, so the first dump would
  # otherwise pair a corrected `timeout` with a stale `--request-timeout=0s`.
