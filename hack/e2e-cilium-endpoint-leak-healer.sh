# Interim CI self-heal for the Cilium in-memory endpoint leak.
#
# This is the heal loop; it runs as an in-cluster Job (see
# hack/e2e-cilium-leak-healer.yaml), deployed during e2e install and left
# running for the whole cluster lifetime. That is deliberate: an earlier
# version ran this as a background process started in the install bats
# setup_file and killed in teardown_file, but bats *_file hooks fire per file,
# so it died when the install file finished — before any app test ran — and the
# leak recurred in the app phase (e.g. the tenant-Kubernetes CVMI importer)
# unhealed. An in-cluster Job is bound to the cluster, not to one bats file, so
# it covers install AND every app test.
#
# Symptom: on a churn-heavy run a pod sticks in ContainerCreating/Init because
# the cilium-agent rejects its sandbox with
#   [PUT /endpoint/{id}][400] putEndpointIdInvalid "IP ipv4:<X> is already in use"
# repeated until the pod is deleted or the agent is restarted. The IP has no
# live owner: IPAM and the ipcache released it, but the agent's in-memory
# endpointManager still holds a stale Endpoint for it (the previous pod's CNI
# DEL was skipped or raced, so unexpose()->removeReferencesLocked() never ran).
# Neither the operator's CiliumEndpoint-CRD GC nor the agent's veth-based
# endpoint GC reaps it, so it wedges the new pod and fails the run. Tracked
# upstream at cilium/cilium#38313 (closed stale); no released or pre-release
# Cilium fixes the leak and no flag disables it.
#
# This watchdog heals in two tiers, least-disruptive first:
#
#   Tier 1 (per-endpoint, default): evict only the orphaned endpoint via
#     cilium-dbg endpoint disconnect ipv4:<X>
#   which maps to DELETE /endpoint/{id} -> RemoveEndpoint -> unexpose ->
#   removeReferencesLocked, clearing the stale IP-keyed entry; or, when a
#   reserved/infra endpoint holds the IP, delete-reschedule the wedged pod onto
#   a free address. Blast radius is one dead endpoint or one pod.
#
#   Tier 2 (per-node escalation): on some variants the leak lives in agent
#   in-memory state that `endpoint disconnect` cannot reach — the IP is no longer
#   in the queryable endpoint registry (so Tier 1 logs "no endpoint holds ip" and
#   no-ops) yet the agent still rejects the sandbox, and IPAM keeps re-handing the
#   SAME IP, so a delete-rescheduled pod just re-wedges on it: an inescapable
#   loop. When the same (node,ip) survives ESCALATE_AFTER heal cycles of Tier 1,
#   escalate to the only remedy that clears an in-memory leak — restart the node's
#   cilium-agent (delete its pod; the DaemonSet recreates it, rebuilding from
#   CRDs/IPAM without the stale entry). This is heavier — it drops the node's
#   whole in-memory endpoint registry — and a production operator would avoid it,
#   but for a test-only, install-phase healer it is the effective, acceptable
#   remedy. It is bounded by a per-node cap (MAX_ESCALATIONS_PER_NODE) so it can
#   never loop-restart agents, and every action is logged loudly with its reason.
#
#   Tier 2 skip: when the disputed IP is exactly the node's per-node Cilium
#   ingress IP (CiliumNode.spec.ingress.ipv4), an agent restart cannot clear it
#   (the agent re-derives the same ingress IP on boot) and can re-trigger the
#   host-scope IPAM restore-window race, so the watchdog skips the restart,
#   surfaces the case, and reschedules the wedged pod best-effort. Full mechanism
#   is in the inline note at that gate.
#
# It is READ-ONLY until it has positively confirmed an orphan: an endpoint in
# the owning node's registry holds the disputed IP, that endpoint does not back
# a live Running pod with that IP, and a different pod is currently wedged
# requesting the same IP. If anything is ambiguous it logs and does nothing —
# it never disconnects a live endpoint. The Tier-2 escalation never fires for a
# refused (genuine duplicate-IP) case: only repeated, confirmed leak candidates
# count toward it, so an agent restart can never mask a real product bug.
#
# REMOVE this script, hack/e2e-cilium-leak-healer.yaml, and the setup_file/
# teardown_file hooks in hack/e2e-install-cozystack.bats once a fixed Cilium
# ships. This is a CI band-aid, not a product fix.
