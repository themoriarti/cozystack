# Unit test: the rabbitmq trust anchor reaches tenants as a key-free projection,
# and the key-BEARING Secrets around it never do.
#
# The chart issues rabbitmq-<name>-ca (CA certificate AND CA private key) and
# rabbitmq-<name>-tls (server certificate AND server private key); the operator
# issues rabbitmq-<name>-erlang-cookie, the cluster's shared secret. None of the
# three may be handed to a tenant: read access to the CA key would let the holder
# issue certificates for anything rather than merely verify the server.
#
# What a client needs is ca.crt alone. cluster-operator produces no CA object of
# its own (spec.tls.caSecretName is an input it only consumes), so the chart mints
# the CA through cert-manager and names that Secret in a TenantProjection
# sentinel. The label selected on below is stamped by the CA-extraction
# controller on the projection it writes, never on the CA Secret.
#
# These assertions exist because both halves are one edit away from breaking with
# a fully green chart suite. The ResourceDefinition is rendered by the rabbitmq-rd
# chart inlining cozyrds/*, and that chart carries no tests directory; the
# dashboard Role is rendered by a chart that has one, but no suite there asserts
# on the whole Role.
#
# The grants are asserted as WHITELISTS against whole values rather than as a
# blacklist of forbidden names over source text. A blacklist grepping for
# "rabbitmq-{{ .name }}-ca" is defeated by quoting the scalar, by a different
# templating of the name, or by a label selector that happens to match it -- all
# of which grant a private key while the guard stays green.
