# Tests that the opensearch README.md has the correct structure after generation.
#
# These are static checks on the committed README.md — they do not invoke
# make generate (which requires cozyvalues-gen in PATH). They verify that:
#   1. tls.issuer description is not truncated (ends with "on and off")
#   2. topologySpreadPolicy appears outside the TLS section
#   3. opensearch-rd cozyrds labels the tenant CA and no server certificate
