# Unit test: the kinds the rabbitmq chart refuses to close the plaintext
# listeners over are the kinds that actually wedge when it does.
#
# Setting tls.disableNonTLSListeners forces messaging-topology-operator onto a
# management API whose per-release CA it cannot verify. Every kind that operator
# drives through its shared TopologyReconciler carries a
# deletion.finalizers.<plural>.rabbitmq.com finalizer that comes off only after a
# successful call there, so all of them stop deleting at the same instant and sit
# in Terminating with the upgrade reporting success. The chart guards the
# transition by listing what is still in the namespace, which is only as good as
# the list it iterates.
#
# The list lives in one place, templates/_topology.tpl, and is read from there by
# the guard and by the confirmation command the refusal prints. This file holds
# it against the two things it can drift from: the operator's own CRDs, which a
# `make update` in packages/system/rabbitmq-operator can change under it, and the
# runbook in the chart README, which an operator follows by hand.
#
# SuperStream is the one CRD in that group deliberately left out. It runs on its
# own reconciler, which sets no finalizer at all, and the Queue, Exchange and
# Binding objects it owns are already covered.
