# Promote a release-candidate to stable by RETAGGING its already-built images —
# no rebuild. Every cluster artifact cozystack ships (component images, the
# cozystack-packages OCI artifact) is content-addressed; this script reads the
# digests the rc baked into the package values.yaml files and copies each, by
# digest, to the stable tag. Because the copy source is the immutable digest,
# the stable image is bit-for-bit the rc image that passed e2e — promotion
# cannot diverge from what was tested.
#
# Usage: hack/promote-retag.sh <stable-version> [--dry-run]
#   <stable-version>  e.g. v1.4.0  (the tag the rc is promoted to)
#   --dry-run         print the skopeo copies without executing them
#
# Environment:
#   MOVE_LATEST=1     also (re)point :latest at each promoted image. OFF by
#                     default: :latest must move only when the version being
#                     promoted is the newest published stable, otherwise a patch
#                     on an older line (e.g. v1.4.6 while 1.5.x is current) would
#                     drag :latest backwards. The caller (finalize) computes this
#                     with the same max-semver test it uses for the release's
#                     make_latest flag and sets MOVE_LATEST accordingly.
#
# Reads image refs from the CURRENT tree (see hack/lib/image-refs.sh for which
# files that covers), which is expected to be the promoted stable
# digest-vendored tree (the release-X.Y.Z branch, whose digests are the rc's —
# only the cosmetic tag string differs).
# Requires: yq (mikefarah), skopeo, sha256sum, and a registry login already done.
#
# The repo/tag split (ref_repo below) strips the :tag from the last path
# component only, so registry hosts that carry a :port are preserved.

# Ref collection (which files are scanned, and the YAML shapes within them) is

# the depth-2 values.yaml, so every ref stored in an images/*.tag file or

# the shape-3 rule was added for — the promotion reports success while never
# creating those images' :<version> tags. Because the retag happens within one
# registry the digests still resolve and digest-pinned installs are unaffected,
# but the release does not carry the tags it claims to. Keep the enumeration in
