# Asserts that the cozystack-basics admission policies name every API version
# the vendored Gateway API CRD bundle actually serves for the kind they gate:
# the three route hostname policies and the Gateway listener hostname policy.
#
# Why this needs a test rather than a comment. The policy lists API versions
# literally in matchConstraints, but the version set it must cover lives in a
# different package (packages/system/gateway-api-crds), is vendored from
# upstream, and moves whenever someone runs `make update` there. Nothing
# connects the two, so the list drifts silently in both directions.
#
# Both directions fail closed-looking and open-behaving. A version the bundle
# serves but the policy does not name is unguarded unless matchPolicy rescues
# it -- and matchPolicy (unset here, so Equivalent) only converts a request
# into a version the rule already names, so that rescue lasts exactly as long
# as at least one named version stays served. A version the policy names but
# the bundle drops takes the rescue away with it: once no named version is
# served the rule selects nothing at all, and failurePolicy: Fail does not
# fire, because nothing failed -- there was simply no match. A fail-closed
# tenant hostname control then stops applying with no error, no denial, and
# no log line. Upstream marks versions deprecated well before removing them,
# so the warning arrives in the bundle diff and nowhere else -- which is
# precisely the diff nobody reads line by line.
#
# Drift here is not caused by a bundle bump: the tlsroutes rule had named a
# single version since the policy was written, while the bundle served three
# the whole time.
#
# The assertion is coverage, not equality: naming a version the bundle does
# not serve is inert (an unmatched resourceRules entry is not an error), so
# the policy may name more than is served, never fewer.
#
# The policy side is read from `helm template` output rather than the template
# source, so what is checked is the object the apiserver would receive.
#
# Paths are repo-root-relative. Direct assertions retain compatibility with
# cozytest, which does not provide Bats-specific helpers or directory variables.
#
# Requires: yq (mikefarah v4+), helm. Both are available on the project's CI
# image and are already relied on by other hack/*.bats.
#
# Run with: bats hack/route-hostname-policy-version-coverage.bats

# The four cases above only ever see a tree that is already correct, so on
# their own they cannot tell a working comparison from one that stopped
# comparing.
# These drive it with synthetic input, the way hack/bats-no-exit-trap.bats and
# hack/md-no-hardwrap.bats feed their checkers a broken sample and require a
# complaint.
#
# Both layers need their own fixture. Driving uncovered() alone leaves
# assert_covers unprotected -- emptying it to a no-op keeps every other case in
# this file green, because the live-tree cases are the only callers and the
# tree they read is correct. So the cases below feed assert_covers itself, in a
# subshell with the two readers redefined.
#
# Each requires the complaint it expects, not merely a non-zero exit. A renamed
# helper exits 127 and an unbound variable under `set -u` exits 1, and either
# would read as a successful rejection if only the status were checked -- red
# for the wrong reason is the same false comfort as no fixture at all.
