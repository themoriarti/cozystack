# Overlay current-main image references onto packages a PR did NOT rebuild.
#
# Source of truth: the cozystack-packages:main OCI artifact build-main.yaml
# already publishes (`make build` -> packages/core/installer image-packages does
# `flux push artifact oci://$REGISTRY/cozystack-packages:main --path=packages`).
# That artifact is the ENTIRE current-main packages tree with every image
# reference digest-pinned to the images build-main just pushed.
#
# We walk EVERY ref-bearing file (values.yaml + images/*.tag) in that tree and
# overlay the repo's copy when it differs only in image-reference lines. This is
# deliberately driven by the artifact, NOT the per-package build matrix, so it
# covers the WHOLE first-party tree — apps/, system/, core/, AND extra/,
# library/, ... For any file build-main did not rebuild, the artifact copy is
# byte-identical to the committed copy and is skipped; only files carrying a
# rebuilt current-main digest differ and get overlaid. So a fix merged to ANY
# first-party image (e.g. the objectstorage-sidecar ref under extra/seaweedfs)
# takes effect in e2e and the installer artifact, instead of the frozen
# last-release refs committed in the repo (e.g. v1.5.0).
#
# Skipped:
#   - units the PR itself rebuilt (BUILT_JSON, the plan job's matrix): their
#     pr-<N>-<sha> refs, already applied in finalize, are authoritative.
#   - packages the PR EDITED (TOUCHED, the plan job's changed-package dirs): the
#     PR's committed refs are its intent (e.g. an upstream image bump in a
#     non-build-unit package), so they must win over the artifact — never overlay.
#   - packages/core/talos and packages/core/installer: rebuilt unconditionally
#     by their dedicated jobs (build-talos / the finalize installer build),
#     which own those files — never overlay them.
#   - vendored charts/ subtrees: upstream chart values we do not build.
#
# Surgical + self-validating: a file is overlaid only when every line that
# differs from the current-main version is image-reference-bearing. The repo's
# committed refs use the release registry (ghcr) while the artifact uses the CI
# registry (OCIR), so refs differ in registry host / tag / digest — and charts
# split those across separate lines (`repository:`, `tag:`, `digest:`), not all
# of which carry '@sha256:'. So a changed line counts as image-related if it
# carries '@sha256:' OR its key is image/repository/registry/tag/digest (or it
# is a `--…-image=` arg). If any OTHER line differs — the PR branched from a
# main whose config for that file differs from the artifact's base — the file is
# left on its committed ref (safe degradation, logged, never fatal). CI checks
# out the pull_request merge commit (current main + PR), so for an unbuilt file
# the config already matches current main and only ref lines differ.
#
# Usage: hack/overlay-main-images.sh <mainpkgs-dir> <built-matrix-json> [touched-pkg-dirs]
#        <mainpkgs-dir>     = extracted cozystack-packages:main tree; its root holds
#                             apps/ system/ core/ extra/ ... (the CONTENTS of
#                             packages/).
#        <built-matrix-json> = JSON array of package dirs the PR rebuilt (skipped).
#        [touched-pkg-dirs]  = whitespace-separated package dirs the PR edited
#                             (no trailing slash); their committed refs are kept.
