# Unit tests for platform migration 55 --> 56 (remove the tenant-cluster FluxCD
# addon). PR #3379 drops packages/system/fluxcd{,-operator}, the last vendored
# copyleft charts, which only backed the optional `addons.fluxcd` toggle of the
# Kubernetes app. For any tenant that had it enabled, the addon's pair of
# HelmReleases must be ORPHANED, not pruned: suspend reconciliation, drop the
# Flux finalizer so the delete does not trigger a Helm uninstall inside the
# tenant cluster, verify the finalizer is actually gone, and only then delete the
# now-inert object from the management cluster. The tenant's own Flux keeps
# running untouched.
#
# Two properties are pinned here:
#
#  1. ORDERING + SELECTION. Only the two fluxcd-addon HelmReleases (matched by
#     .spec.chartRef.name) may be touched, and each must go through
#     suspend -> finalizer-drop -> delete IN THAT ORDER. Deleting before the
#     finalizer is gone would set a deletionTimestamp that makes helm-controller
#     run the very uninstall this migration exists to avoid; touching an
#     unrelated HelmRelease would orphan a release the migration has no business
#     touching.
#
#  2. FAIL CLOSED. Removing the finalizer is the ONLY thing that keeps the delete
#     inert. Migrations never re-run, so a swallowed error here would stamp the
#     version on a half-orphaned fleet and never look back. If the finalizer
#     survives the patch (webhook, RBAC, conflict, transient apiserver error) the
#     migration must abort BEFORE deleting and BEFORE stamping — recoverable on
#     the Job's next attempt, rather than a Helm uninstall that is not.
#
# These drive the real migration script end-to-end against a fake kubectl
# (hack/testdata/migration-55-fluxcd/), mocking only the cluster boundary.
#
# SHELL. Production runs migration 55 under /bin/sh = busybox ash: the migrations
# image is FROM alpine and run-migrations.sh execs `/migrations/<n>` BY PATH, so
# the kernel honours the `#!/bin/sh` shebang. `set -euo pipefail` and its
# errexit-in-function semantics differ from bash, and pipefail is load-bearing:
# the fleet scan pipes `kubectl ... -o json` into jq, so without it a failed list
# would not abort the pipeline and the loop would run against empty input. So,
# exactly as hack/migration-seaweedfs-db-adopt.bats does, run_migration() runs the
# script by path inside the image's own pinned base rather than through a host
# shell — same base image, same interpreter, same invocation form.
#
# jq. Migration 55, unlike the seaweedfs migrations, pipes through jq. The raw
# alpine base ships without it while the built migrations image installs it via
# `apk add`, so prep() bakes jq onto the pinned base once (the only step that
# touches the network) and run_migration() uses that image, still --network none.
# Same base, same busybox ash, plus the one tool the script actually requires;
# the selection logic under test is jq's own, run for real.
#
# CI runs this file under Bats through `make bats-unit-tests`. It also remains
# compatible with the legacy `hack/cozytest.sh` translator, whose awk parser
# rewrites a bare `}` into `return 0` plus `}`. The tests avoid `run`, `$status`,
# and setup() for that path. A helper whose status matters captures and returns
# it before its closing brace so the injected return cannot mask it.
