# Cross-validation between GPU recording rules, the dashboards that consume
# them, and the DCGM Exporter metric set the cluster actually scrapes. Catches:
#
#   1. dangling references — a dashboard query mentions a recording rule name
#      that doesn't exist in gpu-recording.rules.yaml. This is the bug the
#      pre-merge review caught: gpu-efficiency.json shipped panels keyed on
#      pod:tensor_saturation:avg5m without the rule being defined, so the
#      panel showed "No data" everywhere.
#
#   2. typos in rule names — same bug class, manifested as a single-character
#      difference between rule and reference.
#
#   3. undeclared DCGM metrics — a dashboard query or recording rule mentions
#      a DCGM_FI_* metric that is neither in the upstream default CSV nor in
#      the project's custom CSV (dcgm-custom-metrics.yaml), meaning DCGM
#      Exporter would never emit it and the panel silently shows "No data".
#      Example regression: gpu-fleet.json shipped a TDP panel referencing
#      DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_MGMT_LIMIT before the custom CSV declared it.
#
# Scope: only dashboards listed in packages/system/monitoring/dashboards-infra.list
# under the "gpu/" prefix (i.e. shipped to production), not every JSON file in
# dashboards/gpu/. Untracked drafts stay out of scope on purpose — adding one
# to dashboards-infra.list is what brings it under the test.
#
# Reverse direction (rule defined but never consumed) is intentionally NOT
# enforced: some rules exist for ad-hoc PromQL or upcoming dashboards. Treat
# unused rules as an editorial concern, not a regression.
#
# Title syntax constraints from cozytest.sh's awk parser:
#   - Titles delimited by ASCII double quotes; embedded quotes truncate.
#   - Only [A-Za-z0-9] from the title survives into the function name; titles
#     differing only in punctuation collapse to the same function.
#
