# Unit tests for cozy_report_node_join_failure in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh -- the diagnostics the kubernetes-*
# suites emit when fewer than 2 tenant nodes become Ready inside the 18m
# deadline.
#
# What these pin is not what the block prints but that it finishes. It runs
# exactly when the cluster is misbehaving, and its first read goes through the
# tenant kubeconfig to the tenant apiserver -- the component least likely to
# answer in a node-join failure. So every read carries its own wall-clock bound
# and every walk a cap, because an unbounded read here does not lose only
# itself: it holds the Chainsaw op until the op is killed, and the tenant
# crust-gather snapshot that the caller's exit 1 triggers is then lost rather
# than truncated.
#
# The kubectl stub hangs, refuses and answers in part on purpose. A stub that
# always answers cleanly would leave every test here green against an entirely
# unbounded implementation, which is the state this suite was written against.
#
# The block also calls talos_image_cache_diagnose (hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/
# talos-image-cache.sh), whose reads are bounded for the same reason and are
# covered here rather than in that file's own suite, which is mock-free by
# design. Its reachability re-probe is deliberately not bounded there: it spends
# its budget inside a Pod it creates, and shrinking that budget would change
# which image factory the happy path picks.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser ends an @test block at the first bare closing brace,
# so command mocks stay at top level, and there is no bats `run`/`$status`:
# assertions are direct shell tests that exit non-zero on failure. EXIT-trap
# cleanup is banned in hack/*.bats and frozen by a guard in hack/cozyreport.bats,
# so each test removes its own temp dir on its last line.
