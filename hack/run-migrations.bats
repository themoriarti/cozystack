# Unit tests for packages/core/platform/images/migrations/run-migrations.sh.
#
# The migration hook Job retries a failed pod with the environment rendered for
# the first one, so CURRENT_VERSION is what the cluster was on before any
# migration of this upgrade ran. Every migration that finished has stamped the
# cozystack-version ConfigMap since, and a retried pod must start from that
# stamp, or it runs finished migrations a second time.
#
# The runner executes in the migrations image's alpine base (busybox ash, the
# interpreter it ships with) against stand-in migrations and a fake kubectl
# that keeps the stamped version in a file, so one pod's stamps are what the
# next pod reads. The harness shape is hack/migration-58-http-cache-freeze.bats's.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/run-migrations.bats
