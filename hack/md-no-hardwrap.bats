# Unit test: the md-no-hardwrap agent hook.
#
# The hook is a PreToolUse guard for AI coding agents. It refuses two classes
# of write:
#
#   1. Write/Edit/MultiEdit whose resulting markdown contains a prose
#      paragraph, list item or blockquote spanning more than one line.
#   2. Bash invocations of `gh` that publish such a body to GitHub.
#
# Markdown renderers collapse a soft line break into a space, so a paragraph
# hardwrapped at ~80 columns gains nothing and loses on narrow viewports and
# in diffs, where a one-word edit reflows the whole block. Everything that is
# not prose -- code blocks, tables, headings, front matter, link reference
# definitions, explicit hard breaks -- keeps its line breaks, because there a
# break carries meaning.
#
# Two properties matter more than coverage of exotic markdown, and most of
# the cases below defend them:
#
#   * A false positive is worse than a miss. A hook that blocks legitimate
#     work gets switched off, and then it guards nothing.
#   * The single most common wrap -- a bullet the agent broke across two
#     lines -- must be caught. It is the whole reason the hook exists.
#
# The hook speaks the agent hook protocol: a JSON payload on stdin, exit 0 to
# allow, exit 2 to block with an explanation on stderr.
