# Environment:
#   COZY_REPORT_PODS_MAX     max not-Ready pods to collect per-pod evidence for
#                            (default 40). The overflow is named in
#                            COLLECTION-TRUNCATED.txt, never dropped in silence.
#   COZY_REPORT_PODS_BUDGET  wall-clock seconds for that walk (default 600). A
#                            deadline for starting a read, not for finishing the
#                            walk, and rechecked between containers, so the ceiling
#                            is this plus one pod's object reads plus one
#                            container's current AND previous log reads -- a fixed
#                            overshoot, not one that grows with the container
#                            count. The two log reads are consecutive, with no
#                            deadline check between them.
#   COZY_REPORT_POD_TAIL     --tail for the per-pod container logs (default 2000;
#                            -1 for kubectl's own default of the complete log).
#   COZY_REPORT_DIR          where the snapshot tree this report folds in lives
#                            (default `_out/cozyreport`). Shared with
#                            hack/cozytest.sh and hack/e2e-chainsaw/.chainsaw.yaml,
#                            which write the per-test snapshots this script then
#                            picks up; changing it in one place only means the
#                            report collects an empty snapshots directory.
#   COZY_REPORT_PREFER_NS    namespace prefix collected first, so the pod cap is
#                            not spent on unrelated platform namespaces (default
#                            `tenant-`; empty disables the ordering).
# A malformed value in any numeric knob falls back to its default and says so in
# the report.
#
# Bounded, with their cutoffs recorded: the not-Ready pod section, the VM and VMI
# sections, the cozystack-apps listings and the services loop. Sections outside
# that list read without a ceiling; both lists are frozen by tests, because a
# sentence naming which sections are bounded drifts exactly as easily as the
# count of the ones that are not.
# The pod cap and collection budget apply to the pod section only. The fixed
# --tail=2000 reads elsewhere in this file do not name their bound.
#
# THE TOTAL, which no individual section states and which is the number that
# decides whether the tarball survives at all. Each bounded section names its own
# ceiling; nothing sums them, and a reader checking one section reasonably
# concludes the report is bounded by that figure.
#
# Written as the COMPOSITION rather than as one figure, because the figure is what
# goes stale: every term below is a number this file sets, so an editor who changes
# one recomputes instead of trusting a total that silently stopped matching. A
# single figure here is easy to get wrong in the quiet direction: omit the kill
# grace and one class of overshoot and it reads seven minutes short, with nothing
# in the file disagreeing.
#
#   ONE READ            = COZYREPORT_READ_TIMEOUT + the `-k` grace = 30 + 5 = 35s.
#                         The grace counts: `timeout -k 5 30` sends TERM at 30s and
#                         KILLs at 35s, so a read that ignores TERM costs 35s, not
#                         30. hack/e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh states the same rule
#                         for its own pair and budgets 18 + 2 = 20 against it.
#   BUDGETS             = 600s (pods) + 3 x 240s (VM, VMI, services)      = 1320s
#   OVERSHOOT, pods     = a budget gates when a read may START, so the last pod
#                         admitted still runs 4 reads: pod.yaml, describe.txt, and
#                         both log reads of one container.        4 x 35 =  140s
#   OVERSHOOT, objects  = same rule, and the deadline is checked once per iteration
#                         with two reads after it, in each of three walks.
#                                                             3 x 2 x 35 =  210s
#   UNBUDGETED LISTINGS = pods.txt, vms.txt, vmis.txt, services.txt,
#                         applicationdefinitions.txt, tenants.txt. Each is bounded
#                         per read but sits outside every budget window -- the three
#                         object deadlines are set AFTER their own listing read.
#                                                                 6 x 35 =  210s
#                                                                          ------

# So roughly 31 minutes on defaults, and that is a FLOOR, not a bound: the sections
# listed above as unbounded have no ceiling of any kind and are not in this sum, so
# the real worst case is open-ended. It sits inside a job capped at
# `timeout-minutes: 180` whose artifact upload is a LATER step, so a report step
# that runs past the job limit does not truncate the tarball -- the upload never
# runs and the tarball is lost entirely. Anyone raising a budget here should check
# this sum against the job's remaining budget rather than against the section they
# are editing.
#

#
# They exist for the same reason the pod bounds do, and became necessary for a
# sharper one: the services selector read a column that never carries the value it
# filtered for, so that loop had never executed. Correcting it is what makes a
# large selection possible, and the platform ships LoadBalancer services in
# quantity, so an install with no LB provider selects all of them at once. At two
# reads per object and a 30s ceiling each, an unbounded loop clears the job's own

# group. Both belong in the cut-off branch, since either way the file ends before
