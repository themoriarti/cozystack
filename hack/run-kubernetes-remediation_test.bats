# Unit tests for cozy_guard_addon_helmreleases in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh
#
# cozy_guard_helmrelease judges one release; cozy_guard_addon_helmreleases runs
# it over the addon releases a parent installs. One rule decides the verdict:
# the run fails when a release whose install strategy is RetryOnFailure - the
# tenant CNI and CSI and every Application HelmRelease - carries a "failed" or
# "uninstalled" Snapshot. The same footprint on a release using the default
# strategy, which remediates between retry attempts and which these addons pair
# with retries: -1, is reported and left green.
#
# kubectl is stubbed from fixture files, so these tests exercise the wiring the
# guard depends on - the name prefix that selects the addons, the readiness that
# interprets an empty history, and the failure paths of the reads themselves -
# without a cluster. The readings are unit-tested in hack/remediation-guard.bats.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run` or `$status`. Assertions are expressed as
# direct shell tests that exit non-zero on failure. Scratch directories are
# removed at the end of the test body rather than from a trap (both runners set
# -e, so a failed test leaves its fixtures behind for inspection).
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/run-kubernetes-remediation_test.bats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Writes a fixture-driven kubectl stub into $1/bin and returns with $1/fixtures
# created. The stub answers the shapes the guard issues: the namespace listing
# (from ALL_HR), one release's install strategy and Ready condition together
# (<name>.strategy and <name>.ready, joined the way the guard's jsonpath joins
# them), and its history statuses (<name>.history). A missing fixture file
# stands for a field the object does not carry, which is what kubectl prints for
# an absent jsonpath - nothing.
#
# A FAILS marker file makes the matching read exit non-zero with a message on
# stderr, which is how the API answers a timeout or a denied request. That
# looks identical to an absent field on stdout, so it is the case the guard has
# to tell apart by exit status rather than by output. Strategy and readiness
# travel in one read, so a marker on either of them fails that read.
#
# A WARNS marker makes the read write to stderr and still exit 0, which is what
# kubectl does for a deprecation notice or for the discovery noise a degraded
# aggregated APIService produces. No value may pick that line up: inside the
# history capture it turns an empty history into a populated one, which skips
# the readiness branch and reports an uninspected release as clean, and inside
# the strategy capture it stops the value matching RetryOnFailure, which
# downgrades a real failure to a note.
#
# Every invocation appends its arguments to a CALLS file, so a case can assert
# on the shape of the reads rather than only on what they returned.
#
# A TURNS_READY marker beside a history fixture makes serving that read write
# "True" into the release's Ready fixture, which is the interleaving the guard's
# read order has to survive: a release that completes its install between the
# two reads.

# Fixed, advancing clock. The failure-path report bounds its walk on wall time,
# so the cases about that decision own the clock rather than racing it. Empty
# date_now leaves the real one in place for every other case; date_step is how
# far the clock moves per reading, which is what lets a walk cross its deadline
# between two releases without anything sleeping.
#
# The tick count lives in a file rather than in a variable, because every
# reading the report takes is inside a command substitution and a subshell's
# increment does not survive it - a clock that never moved would leave this
# green against a walk with no bound at all.
