# Mirror the latest main-branch build's cozystack-owned component images from the
# CI build registry (OCIR) to the public release registry (GHCR) BY DIGEST — no
# rebuild — and rewrite the baked package tree so the GHCR install closure is
# self-contained on GHCR.
#
# A nightly is a *renamed copy* of what main already built: every image cozystack
# ships is content-addressed, so copying each `<repo>@<digest>` from the source
# registry to the destination registry preserves the digest bit-for-bit. The
# nightly that users install from GHCR is the exact image set built and cached on
# the last push to main — nothing is rebuilt here.
#
# Usage: hack/nightly-mirror.sh <version> <baked-tree-dir> [--dry-run]
#   <version>         dest tag, e.g. 0.0.0-nightly.20260626 (a floating tag is
#                     also moved — see FLOATING)
#   <baked-tree-dir>  the extracted cozystack-packages OCI artifact: a directory
#                     whose layout is <dir>/<group>/<pkg>/values.yaml (apps/,
#                     core/, system/, extra/). This is the digest-vendored tree
#                     main's build baked but never committed.
#   --dry-run         print the skopeo copies and the host rewrite without doing
#                     them
#
# On success the baked tree's values.yaml files have every SRC_REGISTRY image
# host rewritten to DST_REGISTRY (digests untouched). The caller (nightly.yaml)
# then re-pushes that rewritten tree as the GHCR cozystack-packages artifact and
# repackages the cozy-installer chart against it — this script deliberately does
# NOT touch the cozystack-packages artifact itself (it is rebuilt downstream
# from the rewritten content, so a copy here would just be overwritten).
#
# Requires: yq (mikefarah), skopeo, and a login to both registries already done.

  # the published tree pointing at the private CI registry. A `find -name

  # *entire* scalar value, with the repository in a sibling key — kubeovn's
  # `global.registry.address`, now that its image is built here rather than in
  # cozystack/kubeovn-chart. There is no trailing slash for `<src>/` to match, so
  # the host survived the rewrite while the image itself was mirrored, publishing
  # a tree that points at the private CI registry. Anchoring on end-of-line means
  # it only fires when SRC_REGISTRY is the complete value: a contiguous
  # `<src>/<repo>@<digest>` ref continues past the host and is left to the first
  # expression, so the two cannot both fire on one reference.
  #
  # It deliberately does NOT fix keycloak-operator, whose host splits at a
