# Behavioral tests for the pre-delete unpin hook of the kubernetes-nodes chart
# (packages/apps/kubernetes-nodes/templates/pre-delete-unpin.yaml).
#
# helm-unittest (tests/pre_delete_unpin_test.yaml) pins the hook's YAML shape;
# this file tests the embedded shell script's BEHAVIOR: the rendered chart's Job
# args are extracted and executed against a fake kubectl, because the script's
# error classification cannot be asserted from the manifest. The contract under
# test: absence (--ignore-not-found success + empty output) and "present but
# unannotated" are the same no-op, ANY read or list failure fails the Job
# (set -e, retried by backoffLimit) whatever its message says -- treating a
# failure as absent would skip the unpin, report success, and leak the still
# keep-annotated worker objects past the uninstall -- and stderr warnings on
# successful reads never contaminate the annotation value.
#
# Requires helm (present in the unit-tests CI toolchain; the same job installs
# the helm-unittest plugin).
#
# cozytest.sh awk parser: @test blocks only, a bare `}` at column 0 ends a test,
# no run/$status/setup/teardown. Assertions are direct shell tests.
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/kubernetes-nodes-unpin-hook.bats
