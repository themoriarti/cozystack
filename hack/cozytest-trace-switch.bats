# Behavioural tests for the COZYTEST_TRACE switch in hack/cozytest.sh.
#
# The runner streams every @test body's xtrace live. Across the unit suites that
# was 233,444 of 238,794 lines in one job log, with the single failing assertion
# at line 238,573, so `make unit-tests` now runs with the stream off. What makes
# that safe is a single invariant: run_one tees the raw stream to $log and the
# fail handler prints all of it for whichever test fails, so quiet mode drops
# the output of PASSING tests only.
#
# That invariant fails SILENTLY. It is only exercised when a test fails, so a
# green CI run proves nothing about it: a refactor of run_one's reader loop that
# also broke the dump would ship, and would be discovered by whoever next needed
# a red unit run diagnosed -- with no trace, having already lost the run. Hence
# a suite whose fixtures fail on purpose.
#
# Both directions are pinned, and the verbose one is the positive control for
# the quiet one: "no trace lines" is satisfied just as well by a harness where
# nothing ran at all.
#
# awk-transform constraint (hack/cozytest.sh rewrites this file before sourcing
# it, see the longer note in hack/cozytest-capture-gate.bats): a line beginning
# `@test "` becomes a function header wherever it appears, heredocs included, so
# a fixture written as a heredoc gets its own @test harvested into THIS suite.
# The fixtures below are built with printf, which puts that text inside a format
# string where no rule matches it. Titles must also stay distinctive in their
# [A-Za-z0-9] run, which is all that survives into the function name.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/cozytest-trace-switch.bats
