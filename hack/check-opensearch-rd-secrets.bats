# Unit test: the opensearch ResourceDefinition hands tenants the key-free trust
# anchor and nothing else.
#
# The chart issues opensearch-<name>.http-ca (CA certificate AND CA private key,
# the latter under tls.key), opensearch-<name>-http-server and
# opensearch-<name>-dashboards-server (each a server certificate AND its private
# key). None may reach a tenant: read access to the CA key would let the holder
# issue certificates for anything rather than merely verify the server. What a
# client needs is ca.crt alone, delivered by the CA-extraction controller as the
# key-free <release>.tenant-ca projection and selected by LABEL rather than by
# name, because a name grant conveys whatever happens to occupy that name.
#
# Asserted against the RENDERED chart, not against cozyrds/opensearch.yaml on
# disk. templates/cozyrd.yaml globs cozyrds/* and emits each match through
# .Files.Get, so what ships is the render: reading one source file would miss a
# second file in that directory, and a dotfile the glob picks up. Helm ignores
# dotfiles only under templates/, so one here does ship. That is the whole reason
# this file exists alongside hack/check-opensearch-readme.bats, which asserts the
# same include shape by reading the one source file — narrower on purpose, and
# blind to exactly this.
#
# This lives in bats rather than helm-unittest because packages/system/
# opensearch-rd has no `test:` target, and hack/helm-unit-tests.sh skips any
# package without one. If that package ever grows one, this belongs there.
#
# spec.secrets is compared WHOLE rather than probed for known-bad names. Three
# ways this breaks are invisible to a name-by-name check:
#
#   - a name added under a different spelling, or via a helper;
#   - an include with NO resourceNames and NO matchLabels, which restricts
#     nothing;
#   - a SECOND matchLabels include selecting a label the key-bearing Secrets also
#     carry. cert-manager stamps controller.cert-manager.io/fao on every Secret it
#     creates, all three of these among them, so one such entry grants the CA
#     private key while every name in the file stays correct.
