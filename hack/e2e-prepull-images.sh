# Reads image references from stdin, one per line. Empty lines and lines
# starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Some workloads (OVN raft, LINSTOR, cert-manager) are sensitive to slow or
# staggered pulls at install time: a HelmRelease can time out while one node
# is still pulling. Pre-pulling eliminates the stagger.
#
# Distroless images (cert-manager, etc.) ship no shell or `sleep`, so we
# can't just `command: ["sleep", "infinity"]`. Trick: an initContainer copies
# busybox (a static binary) into a shared emptyDir, then every prepull
# container execs /shared/sleep — the kernel execve's the binary from the
# volume, the container's filesystem doesn't need to provide it.
