# Unit tests for the fail-closed contract of
# packages/core/platform/images/migrations/migrations/47
#
# Migration 47 pins the implicit default `md0` node group on existing tenant
# Kubernetes clusters before the kubernetes chart stops shipping a baked-in
# md0. Its safety property is the ENTIRE reason it exists: if any per-object
# read or patch fails, it must abort (exit 1) BEFORE stamping the
# cozystack-version ConfigMap, so the pre-upgrade hook fails and Helm never
# rolls the new chart against an un-pinned cluster (whose live md0
# MachineDeployment would otherwise be pruned → CAPI Machine/node deletion).
#
# These tests pin that branch so it cannot silently regress to fail-open. We
# put a fake `kubectl` on PATH and assert that:
#   - a non-NotFound read failure aborts non-zero and never reaches the stamp;
#   - a patch failure aborts non-zero and never reaches the stamp;
#   - a clean run DOES reach the stamp (positive control, so "no stamp" above
#     is a real signal and not a script that simply never called kubectl).
# "The stamp ran" is detected by the version stamp's `kubectl apply` appearing
# in the fake's call log — equivalently, CURRENT_VERSION was/was not advanced.
#
# CI runs this file under Bats through `make bats-unit-tests`. It also remains
# compatible with the legacy `hack/cozytest.sh` translator, whose awk parser
# recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` at column 0. The tests avoid
# `run`, `$status`, setup(), and teardown() for that compatibility path. Their
# assertions are direct shell tests, and the
# fake-kubectl heredocs deliberately keep every `}` off column 0 so the parser
# does not mistake one for the end of a test. Each @test runs in its own
# subshell, and cleanup is inline (no EXIT/RETURN trap — see
# docs/agents/e2e-testing.md §3).
#
# Run with: bats hack/kubernetes-md0-migration.bats

#   - the --all-namespaces list always returns one object (tenant-test/demo);
#   - the per-object `get ... --output json` fails (MOCK_FAIL=read) or returns
#     an object whose nodeGroups lacks md0 (so the migration tries to patch);
#   - `patch` fails when MOCK_FAIL=patch, else succeeds;
#   - `apply` (the version stamp) is a no-op that drains stdin.
# No line below is a bare column-0 `}`, so cozytest.sh's parser leaves it intact.
