# Unit test: mariadb-rd's tenant grant surface. The chart's helm-unittest suite
# cannot reach this package, so its Secret-exposure invariants are pinned here.
#
# The tenant reaches the TLS trust anchor as a key-free projection, never by
# name. The chart renders a TenantProjection sentinel naming the operator's
# key-free <release>-ca-bundle as the extraction source
# (packages/apps/mariadb/templates/tenant-projection.yaml); the CA-extraction
# controller publishes the result as "<release>.tenant-ca" carrying
# internal.cozystack.io/tenant-ca; and this ApplicationDefinition selects that
# label. The sentinel's own fields belong to the chart and are pinned by
# packages/apps/mariadb/tests/tenant_projection_test.yaml, which compares
# sourceSecretName against an exact key-free name — a stronger guard than any
# grep here could be, and one this file cannot make, since it never sees the
# chart.
#
# Asserted against the RENDERED chart, not against cozyrds/mariadb.yaml on
# disk, following hack/check-qdrant-rd-secrets.bats. templates/cozyrd.yaml
# globs cozyrds/* and emits each match through .Files.Get, so what ships is the
# render: reading one source file would miss a second file in that directory,
# and a dotfile the glob picks up. Helm ignores dotfiles only under templates/,
# so one here does ship.
#
# spec.secrets and spec.services are each compared WHOLE rather than probed for
# known-bad shapes. Probing is what a name-shaped check cannot see:
#
#   - an exclude entry that selects by LABEL instead of by name. matchName
#     returns true for every name when resourceNames is nil
#     (internal/lineagecontrollerwebhook/matcher.go), and exclude wins over
#     include, so one such entry withholds everything — the tenant's
#     connection string and its trust anchor included. A pass reading
#     .exclude[].resourceNames[]? cannot see an entry that has no
#     resourceNames at all.
#   - an entry that restricts nothing, spelled as an empty matchLabels, an
#     empty matchExpressions, or a bare {}. Only the first is a literal anyone
#     greps for; ApplicationDefinitionResourceSelector inlines
#     metav1.LabelSelector, so all three are legal.
#   - a SECOND matchLabels include selecting a label the key-bearing Secrets
#     also carry. cert-manager stamps controller.cert-manager.io/fao on both
#     .ca-tls and .tls, so one such entry grants the CA private key while every
#     name in the file stays correct.
#
# Order within each list is meaningless — the matcher ORs across entries — so
# both are sorted before comparing, and an absent list is normalized to the
# empty list it means. The sort is jq's, which orders objects; yq's sort would
# leave a list of maps as it found it.
#
# Every document count uses `yq eval-all`, never `yq eval`: `eval` runs the
# expression once PER DOCUMENT, so `[.] | length` reports 1 per document rather
# than the number of them. Emptiness is checked separately, since yq
# synthesizes a null document for empty input.
#
# Everything is spelled inline rather than through a shell helper:
# hack/cozytest.sh inserts `return 0` before any line that is exactly `}`, so a
# helper whose own last command decides the outcome returns 0 regardless.
