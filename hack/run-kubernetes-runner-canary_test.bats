# Regression coverage for the runner fixed-work canary in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh. cozytest.sh ends an @test block at
# the first bare closing brace, so command mocks stay at top level.
#
# What this collector is for, and why its failure modes are worth pinning. No
# counter that file already reads carries a unit of work of its own, whatever
# unit it is read in; this one runs a fixed amount of work and times it, which
# is what gives its reading a scale of its own and lets it call a single red run
# pathological with no green run beside it. That scale is exactly what a wrong
# duration destroys, and a wrong duration is cheap to produce: a clock field
# parsed with the wrong number of decimals is off by a factor of ten, which is
# the size of the effect being hunted, and a capture reporting it would read like
# a finding rather than like a bug.
#
# So most of what follows is about the arithmetic and about the difference
# between silence and a reading. An arm nobody could time, an arm stopped at its
# ceiling and an arm that ran to the end are three different things, and only
# the last of them is a rate.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/run-kubernetes-runner-canary_test.bats
#
# cozytest.sh is the canonical runner and the CI path: it runs this file under
# `sh` with `set -eu`, and in CI that `sh` is dash, which is what the collector
# meets in the sandbox image. `bats` runs the same file under bash without those
# flags, so it is a convenience rather than an equal alternative: the guards
# here that exist for dash semantics do not fire under it. Spelling the capture
# truncation `: >` again -- the regression the guard below is written for --
# leaves bats green, and leaves cozytest green too wherever /bin/sh is not dash,
# which includes macOS, where it is bash in POSIX mode. Run `dash
# hack/cozytest.sh` to exercise those guards off CI.
