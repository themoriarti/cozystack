# Rewrite the rc version substring to the stable version in every vendored
# first-party image reference. Promotion does not rebuild: the digests stay
# exactly as the rc built them, and only the cosmetic tag string moves from
# "1.6.0-rc.4" to "1.6.0" so the shipped tree reads as the release it is.
#
# Usage: hack/promote-rewrite-tags.sh <rc-version> <stable-version> [root]
#   <rc-version>      e.g. 1.6.0-rc.4   (no leading v — the substring as it
#                     appears inside an image tag)
#   <stable-version>  e.g. 1.6.0
#   [root]            tree to rewrite; defaults to "packages"
#
# This lived inline in .github/workflows/promote-rc.yaml until it shipped a
# release whose tags were half-rewritten. Its glob covered the depth-2
# values.yaml plus packages/apps/kubernetes/images/*.tag alone, on the premise
# that the kubernetes app was the only one whose .tag files carry the cozystack
# version — nine other .tag files and one stamped template do. Because the step
# was workflow-inline there was nothing to unit test, so the miss was only
# observable by cutting a release. It is a script so that
# hack/promote-rewrite-tags_test.bats can round-trip it against the real tree.
#
# grep's -r/-I/--exclude/--exclude-dir are non-POSIX, but both GNU and BSD grep
# implement them, so this runs unchanged on the CI runners, in the build image,
# and on a macOS developer box. The edit is written through a temp file rather
# than `sed -i`, whose argument handling differs between the two seds.

# Postcondition: scan WIDER than the rewrite. The rewrite is deliberately
# narrow — a blind walk of every file under $ROOT would rewrite vendored chart
# defaults that `make update` regenerates — but a narrow rewrite is exactly
# what shipped a half-promoted release, so the check that follows it must not
# share its blind spot. Anything still carrying the rc string here is a ref in
# a storage location the enumeration does not know about: fail the promotion
# loudly rather than publish a release whose images claim to be a release
# candidate.
#
# It must, however, only flag strings that could actually BE an image ref.
# "X.Y.Z-rc.N" is an ordinary version string that other things legitimately
# contain, and a false positive here fails a workflow that runs once per
# release, on release day. Three live examples, each of which aborted the
# promotion before this was shape-filtered:
#   - packages/apps/kubernetes/images/kubevirt-csi-driver/go.sum pins
#     github.com/golang/protobuf v1.4.0-rc.2 — and v1.4.0-rc.2 is a cozystack
#     rc that was actually cut, so this was not hypothetical
#   - packages/system/metallb/tests/metallb_test.yaml has a comment naming
#     v1.5.0-rc.2 as an example of what release-prep stamps
#   - the console's pnpm-lock.yaml carries rolldown@1.0.0-rc.15 and friends
#
# So match the version only where it appears in ref position: after an
# image/repository/tag key (with no `#` in between, which excludes prose in a
# trailing comment), or immediately before an @sha256 digest. The second branch
# is what catches a bare .tag file, whose content has no YAML key at all. The
# first is required for the split shape where the version and the digest live
# under separate keys — packages/system/cilium/values.yaml has `tag: v1.5.0`
# and `digest:` on the next line — so narrowing this to "${RC}@sha256:" alone
# would silently stop covering it.
#
# charts/ is excluded because a vendored upstream chart may legitimately pin an
# unrelated component whose own version happens to contain the substring, and
# the build never stamps into one. Markdown is excluded because documentation
# legitimately names release candidates — an upgrade note or a README example
# citing the rc being promoted is correct prose, not an unrewritten ref.
