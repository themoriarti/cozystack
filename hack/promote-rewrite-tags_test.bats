# Tests for hack/promote-rewrite-tags.sh — the rc->stable tag string rewrite.
#
# Guards the regression that shipped a half-promoted release: the rewrite lived
# inline in .github/workflows/promote-rc.yaml and globbed the depth-2
# values.yaml plus packages/apps/kubernetes/images/*.tag alone, on the premise
# that the kubernetes app was the only one whose .tag files carry the cozystack
# version. Nine other .tag files and one stamped template do, so v1.6.0 was
# staged with 33 refs still reading v1.6.0-rc.4. Being workflow-inline, there
# was nothing to unit test and the miss was only observable by cutting a
# release.
#
# The central test therefore round-trips against the REAL tree and — crucially —
# discovers ref-bearing files BY CONTENT rather than by asking the enumeration
# under test where to look. A fixture built from image_ref_files() could only
# ever confirm that the enumeration agrees with itself; grepping for the
# registry prefix finds files it has never heard of, which is the whole failure
# mode. Stamp wider than the rewrite, then assert the rewrite cleaned all of it.
#
# Harness note: the CI path is hack/cozytest.sh, NOT real bats. cozytest.sh's
# awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its own line; there
# is no `run`, `$status`, `$output`, `skip`, or setup()/teardown(). Each test
# runs as a shell function under `set -eu -x`, so a non-zero exit aborts the
# test (that is the exit-0 assertion). A test that expects a non-zero exit must
# capture it with `|| rc=$?` so the harness's `set -e` does not abort first.
# Paths are repo-root-relative: BATS_TEST_DIRNAME is unset here and would abort
# the whole suite under `set -u`.
