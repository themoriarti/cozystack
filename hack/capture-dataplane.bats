# EXIT-TRAP DEBT: 1 -- see hack/bats-no-exit-trap.bats; lower it as the traps go, delete it at zero.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unit tests for the pure decision/parsing helpers in
# hack/e2e-capture-dataplane.sh -- specifically the LoadBalancer-datapath
# section, which fires for a Service type=LoadBalancer whose external IP is
# unreachable while its backend stays Ready (the NotReady-pod path never sees
# this case). Only the pure logic is unit-testable here:
#
#   - lb_filter_services      -- keep only LoadBalancer rows with an ingress IP;
#   - lb_first_ready_endpoint -- pick the first addressed, non-NotReady endpoint;
#   - lb_announcer_node       -- the speaker node of the most recent announce;
#   - lb_capture_decision     -- capture only when every probe failed.
#   - pod_filter_affected     -- retain scheduled NotReady pods even without IPs.
#
# The kubectl exec / tcpdump capture itself is not unit-testable (it needs a
# live cluster); these tests pin the derivations that decide WHICH node to
# capture on and WHETHER to capture at all, fed mock kubectl/log output.
#
# Strategy: the script is sourced once with E2E_CAPTURE_DATAPLANE_LIB set, which
# the script's sourcing guard honours by defining the helpers and returning
# before it touches $1 or runs any capture -- so no cluster is required and the
# capture body never executes. Each @test then calls the helpers directly and
# asserts with `[ ... ]`, matching this repo's plain-shell bats convention (no
# `run` helper). Mock IPs use the RFC 5737 / RFC 3849 documentation ranges.
#
# Title syntax constraints (inherited from cozytest.sh's awk parser):
#   - Titles delimited by ASCII double quotes; embedded quotes truncate.
#   - Only [A-Za-z0-9] from the title survives into the function name, so keep
#     titles distinctive in their alphanumeric run.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/capture-dataplane.bats
#           (or `bats hack/capture-dataplane.bats` if the bats binary is
#           installed; cozytest.sh is the CI path.)
