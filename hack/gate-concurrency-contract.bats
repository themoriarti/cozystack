# Contract for the invariants that decide who owns, publishes and skips the
# required "E2E Tests" commit status (see docs/agents/e2e-testing.md §10): the
# concurrency keys, the publishing points, and the docs-only decision the two
# lanes have to answer identically.
#
# The gate is a status, not a job, so a run that dies without posting leaves the
# head SHA at "Expected" and blocks the merge forever. That makes the pairing
# below load-bearing: `e2e-fork.yaml`'s `resolve` declines to post for a
# triggering run that concluded `cancelled`/`skipped`, and the workflow's
# concurrency key must put exactly those runs in a group of their own so a run
# that posts nothing cannot cancel the run that does. The two lists live in
# different languages in different halves of the file and can drift apart in a
# way no reviewer diff makes obvious — a third discarded conclusion added to the
# JS guard alone silently restores the wedge. These tests pin executable lines
# only: a commented-out key must never satisfy the contract.
#
# Scope, so the pin is not read as covering more than it does: `resolve` has a
# THIRD silent path, taken when the triggering run succeeded but its `Plan
# build` job skipped, and the concurrency key does not represent it. That is
# deliberate and currently unreachable — every job in pull-requests.yaml either
# carries the discarded-label guard or reaches `plan` through its `needs`, some
# of them only via another job's result rather than by reading plan's outputs
# directly, so a skipped `plan` means a skipped run, which the conclusion check
# already catches. Transitivity is the load-bearing part of that claim. It
# stops being unreachable the moment a job is added that runs independently of
# `plan`, and the extraction below, which matches on `CONCLUSION === '…'`,
# will not notice. Whoever adds such a job owns that.

# Drop YAML `#` and JavaScript `//` comment lines, so a commented-out key can
