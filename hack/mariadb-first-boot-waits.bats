# Contract: nothing that waits for a database HelmRelease to become Ready may
# allow less than that release can legitimately take. The backup walkthroughs
# of the suites in MBW_SUITES carry such waits, and each suite is checked on
# its own; for mariadb the chainsaw suite's HR-Ready asserts are checked too.
# The other suites' HR-Ready asserts are not checked here.
#
# A wait has two floors and must beat the larger one by MBW_START_MARGIN. The
# margin is a policy value, not a measurement: it stands for the time the
# wait's clock runs before the install's -- the Application reconcile, the
# chart artifact fetch and the helm-controller queue -- none of which the tree
# bounds. It equals the headroom every wait held here already carries.
#
# The first floor is the chart's first-boot budget, computed only for a suite
# whose MBW_SUITES row names a chart with a startupProbe; for the others only a
# measurement could give it. For mariadb: helm-controller defaults
# spec.waitStrategy to `poller`, kstatus has no rule for
# k8s.mariadb.com/MariaDB and reads its Ready=False as InProgress, so the
# install MAY span a first boot. "May", because a poll landing before the
# operator's first status write reads a condition-less CR as Current, which is
# why the suite keeps an endpoint assert after the HR-Ready one. The budget is
# initialDelaySeconds + (failureThreshold - 1) * periodSeconds, with the
# threshold from the chart and the operator's defaults of 20 and 10 (both
# probe shapes, in mariadb-operator's pkg/builder/container_builder.go). It
# is one boot, not one per replica, because the operator sets
# PodManagementPolicy: Parallel. Were that wrong, two replicas would serialize
# to 620s, the floor would bind there, and 660 would fall short of the margin
# over it.
#
# The second floor is the install timeout cozystack-api stamps on the release
# (pkg/cmd/server/start.go). A wait equal to it expires first, because its clock
# starts when the step runs and the install's only after the Application is
# reconciled and the chart fetched. Of the floors this file computes, it is
# the one that binds today in every suite. Each suite's ApplicationDefinition
# is held to not override it.
#
# What is not guarded, because each would make the numbers slack rather than
# short: cozystack-api taking --helmrelease-install-timeout from a manifest
# (only cozystack-operator is passed it today); a waitStrategy of `legacy` on
# a suite's RD; the UseHelm3Defaults feature gate. healthCheckExprs alone
# resolves to `poller`, so it is not a lever. Also unguarded: an operator bump
# that moves the probe defaults; a timed non-HelmRelease assert placed ahead of
# the HelmRelease one inside a wait-helmrelease-ready step, or an HR-Ready
# assert in a step with another name, since the suite extractor selects by step
# name and takes the first timeout in the step.
#
# The waits are also held against the Chainsaw op that runs the walkthrough,
# because an op that runs out SIGKILLs the script and loses its error. Per
# suite, the op minus the HelmRelease waits it reaches, bucket included, must
# keep the remainder in MBW_SUITES; a wait the op never reaches, the mongodb
# target behind the SKIP_RESTORE=1 its op passes, is not counted. For mariadb
# the op minus the ceilings up to and including the source wait is held as well;
# extending that past the source wait would sum ceilings the script reaches only
# on the happy path. Every remainder sits at exactly its constant, so raising a
# wait without raising the op reds.
#
# The errexit test reaches beyond the MBW_SUITES walkthrough waits:
# wait_hr_ready is defined once, in examples/backups/_lib/wait-helpers.sh, for
# every backup example, and that test runs its exit branches through the
# helpers run-all.sh sources. hack/backup-examples-shared-helpers.bats holds it
# to that one definition.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run` or `$status`, and no setup/teardown.
# Assertions are direct shell tests that exit non-zero. A `}` at column zero
# gets `return 0` inserted ahead of it, so the helpers below report through
# stdout only and never through an exit status.
