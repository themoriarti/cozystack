# Given the E2E app suite(s) about to run, emit the conservative set of packages
# that must be INSTALLED for those suites: the suite owners and runtime needs,
# the E2E install baseline, and their forward PackageSource dependency closure.
# This is the install-side companion to select-e2e.sh:
# select-e2e.sh picks WHICH Chainsaw suites run (reverse dependency walk);
# select-install.sh picks WHAT must be up for them (forward dependency walk).
#
# Usage:
#   hack/select-install.sh <suites> [<sources-dir>]
#   hack/select-install.sh --disabled <suites> [<sources-dir>]
#   hack/select-install.sh --validate [<sources-dir> [<suites-dir>]]
#
# Defaults: sources-dir = packages/core/platform/sources
#           suites-dir  = hack/e2e-chainsaw
#
# <suites>: whitespace-separated suite names, i.e. the output of select-e2e.sh
#           (e.g. "postgres harbor"). "-" reads the list from stdin.
#
# Output (closure mode): space-separated PackageSource names (cozystack.*) that
#   the run must enable, seeds + the platform baseline + all transitive
#   dependsOn. Empty when <suites> is empty.
#
# Output (--disabled): the COMPLEMENT of that closure, for bundles.disabledPackages
#   in the platform chart. The base package helper in
#   packages/core/platform/templates/_helpers.tpl consults disabledPackages for
#   every package rather than only the optional ones, so an ordinary variant
#   can be reduced by subtraction with no new variant. Refuses on an empty
#   selection, where the complement would be the whole platform.
#
#   Two limits worth knowing before consuming it.
#
#   Subtraction governs a FRESH install only. Both package defines stamp
#   `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so adding a name on a live cluster stops
#   emitting the Package CR but does not remove the one already there; the
#   package stays installed. Fine for a per-run E2E install, wrong as a way to
#   uninstall.
#
#   Packages emitted through package.optional (nfs-driver, telepresence,
#   external-dns, external-dns-application, and the others gated the same way)
#   need bundles.enabledPackages as well. Keeping one in the closure is
#   therefore not enough to install it, and a suite whose closure contains one
#   needs that list set separately. Subtraction is correct for them either way,
#   since an optional package absent from enabledPackages is not installed
#   regardless.
#
#   The declared graph is not the whole runtime contract. The standard E2E
#   install waits for storage, load-balancer, CAPI and OIDC components which no
#   selected application necessarily reaches, so they are explicit baseline
#   seeds below. This mode describes a FRESH install using that audited path;
#   live convergence still has to be proved separately. A suite with no known
#   mapping is a HARD ERROR (fail closed) — a silently-skipped suite would
#   install nothing and let the test pass vacuously or fail later on a missing
#   CRD.
#
# --validate: check the whole graph AND the suite mapping — every dependsOn
#   target resolves to a real PackageSource, there are no dependency cycles, and
#   every Chainsaw suite under <suites-dir> has real PackageSources for both its
#   owners and runtime requirements. Exit non-zero on any failure. The graph
#   is read from the current PackageSource inventory. The hand-maintained suite
#   mapping can drift independently, so validation checks it against both that
#   inventory and the current suite directories.
#
# Unlike select-e2e.sh's reverse walk, the forward walk KEEPS the
# cozystack.cozystack-engine edge: every *-application declares
# `dependsOn: cozystack.cozystack-engine` because the app's *-rd HelmRelease
# needs the engine to register the ApplicationDefinition CRD before it can
# reconcile. For test SELECTION that edge is noise (it would fan every app out
# to every other); for INSTALL it is a genuine prerequisite that must be up.
# Suites backed by a system package (e.g. securitygroup) carry no such edge, so
# the engine is seeded explicitly for any non-empty closure (see below).
