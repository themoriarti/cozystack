# shellcheck shell=sh
# Shared enumeration of where cozystack vendors its image references.
#
# Sourced by hack/promote-rewrite-tags.sh, hack/promote-retag.sh,
# hack/nightly-mirror.sh and hack/verify-promoted-packages.sh. It exists because
# the first three call sites each grew their own idea of where a ref can live,
# and drifted: promote-retag and nightly-mirror scanned only the depth-2
# values.yaml, while the promote workflow's tag rewrite scanned those plus
# packages/apps/kubernetes/images/*.tag alone. Every ref stored in any OTHER
# images/*.tag file was therefore invisible to all three — never retagged to
# the stable version in the registry, never mirrored to GHCR for a nightly, and
# left carrying the rc version string in a promoted release tree. The verifier
# is a later consumer that has only ever read this enumeration: it compares the
# stable candidate's refs against the rc artifact's to prove promotion moved no
# container bytes, so a shape it could not see would be a proof that passed over
# the images it skipped. See docs/agents/image-refs.md for the contract this
# file implements; a new storage location must be added here and nowhere else.
#
# Three storage shapes exist, and all are first-class:
#
#   1. <root>/<group>/<pkg>/values.yaml     — five YAML sub-shapes, below
#   2. <root>/<group>/<pkg>/images/*.tag    — a plain file holding one ref
#   3. an explicitly declared file (IMAGE_REF_EXTRA_FILES) whose producer sed's
#      a ref straight into it because the package is not values-driven
#
# The .tag files are consumed by templates via .Files.Get rather than through
# values, which is why they are easy to forget; they are otherwise ordinary
# first-party refs and carry the cozystack version exactly like values.yaml.
#
# <root> is "packages" for the committed tree and the extracted artifact
# directory for a baked tree; both use the same <group>/<pkg> layout below it.

# Root-relative files that hold a first-party ref outside the two globs above.
# Kept as an explicit list rather than a templates/** glob: that glob would
# sweep in every vendored upstream chart template and every Helm-templated
# `image:` line, where a blind rewrite corrupts a value `make update`
# regenerates. An entry here is a deliberate statement that some package's
# `image:` target sed's a ref into a file it vendors from upstream.
#
# system/multus is the only one today: its templates/ is the upstream
# multus-daemonset-thick.yml fetched by `make update`, and multus's Makefile
# `image:` target sed's the built ref into every `multus-cni` `image:` line
# inside it.
#
# KNOWN GAP, deliberately not listed: system/capi-providers-cpprovider stamps
# its kamaji ref into files/control-plane-components.yaml AND into the
# files/components.gz built from it, and the chart ships the .gz
# (templates/configmaps.yaml reads it with .Files.Get). Declaring only the
# readable .yaml would rewrite the copy nothing consumes and leave it diverged
# from the copy that does, which is worse than leaving both alone. Nothing is
# currently owed to it: kamaji is component-versioned (v0.19.0-cozystack.N), so
# no tag rewrite is due, and the image is still retagged and mirrored via
# images/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji.tag, which carries the same
# repo@digest. The residual is that a nightly's kamaji ConfigMap keeps the
# private build-registry host, since the mirror's host rewrite cannot reach
# inside a gzip. Fixing it means decompress/rewrite/recompress with `gzip -n`
# to stay reproducible — see docs/agents/image-refs.md.
# Assigned unconditionally rather than via ${VAR:-default}: this list is
# safety-critical for the retag and the mirror, neither of which has a
# postcondition that would notice it being wrong. An inherited environment
# variable able to silently NARROW it is a hazard with no matching use case.
# Word splitting is intended (the list is whitespace-separated), which also
# means a path containing whitespace cannot be represented here.

# Emit every "<repo>[:<tag>]@sha256:<digest>" ref found under <root>.
#
# The YAML shapes below are the ones present in the tree today, found by
# auditing every @sha256: digest under the depth-2 values.yaml against this
# selector's output — NOT a closed set the build is known to be limited to.
# Charts are vendored from upstream and their values layout is theirs to
# change, so treat the list as empirical and re-run that audit when a package
# is added:
#   1. single string  <repo>:<tag>@sha256:<digest>   (e.g. .cozystackAPI.image)
#   2. split map      {[registry,] repository, tag, digest}   (e.g. .cilium.image)
#   3. split map      {[registry,] repository, tag: <tag>@sha256:<digest>}
#                     (e.g. .linstorCSI.image; .keycloak-operator.image adds registry)
#   4. chart-global   global.registry.address + global.images.<n>.{repository, tag}
#                     (kube-ovn's wrapper chart)
#   5. OCI artifact   {platformSourceUrl: oci://<repo>, platformSourceRef: digest=sha256:<digest>}
#
# The optional `registry` sibling in shapes 2/3 and the whole of shape 4 exist
# because the host does not always live inside `repository`. When it does not,
# the rule must rejoin it: a host-less ref reaches the caller's ownership
# filter looking third-party and is dropped, which is the silent-skip failure
# the shape-3 rule was added to fix.
#
# Shape 3 is the dominant one: most package Makefiles set `.image.tag` to
# "$(IMAGE_TAG)@$(digest)" in a single yq call instead of maintaining a
# separate `digest` key. It matches neither shape 2 (no `digest` key) nor,
# usefully, shape 1 — that rule sees only the bare tag value, which carries no
# repository, so a caller's ref_repo() reduces "<tag>@sha256:<digest>" to
# "<tag>" and the ownership filter drops it.
#
# The `tag == "!!str"` guard is load-bearing: yq's test() aborts the expression
# on a non-string tag ("cannot match with !!int"), and since these invocations
# swallow stderr and status, that abort would silently drop every shape-3 ref
# in the same file. `tag: 1.24` unquoted in a neighbouring third-party block is
# enough. Rule 1 is immune — its select(tag == "!!str") precedes its test().
#
# `registry`, `repository` and `digest` are guarded the same way against a
# different failure: they are string-concatenated rather than test()ed, and yq
# coerces most scalars on `+`, so only a !!map aborts ("!!str () cannot be
# added to a !!map") and takes the whole file's expression with it. Being a
# select() rather than a test(), the guard drops just the offending map.
# Emit every ref found in ONE file. Split out from collect_image_refs so a test
# can apply the same shape knowledge to an independently discovered file list:
# what drifted historically was which FILES each consumer looked at, not how a
# ref is spelled inside one, so an oracle wants to vary the former and hold the
# latter. Shape coverage is pinned separately by per-shape tests, which is why
# sharing this half does not weaken the suite.
#
# YAML is parsed; anything else is scraped textually. A .tag file has no YAML
# structure to speak of, and a declared extra file may be a manifest whose ref
# yq would find anyway — running both on it would merely duplicate, and the
# callers dedup.

  # Declared extras additionally get the textual scrape, even though most are

  # shape means: an extra is a manifest vendored from upstream, so it can carry
  # a ref inside a block scalar (a ConfigMap embedding a whole deployment, say),
  # where yq returns the enclosing block rather than the ref and the caller's
  # ownership filter then discards it — and it can stop parsing entirely, when
  # `make update` pulls a version yq chokes on or when the package patches Helm
  # syntax into the vendored file. Both are silent skips, which is the failure
  # mode this library exists to remove. Running both and letting the callers'
  # existing dedup absorb the overlap costs nothing.
  #
  # The multus entry is in the second state today: its staging init container is
  # wrapped in Helm conditionals, so yq refuses the whole file and this scrape is
  # not a backstop for it but the only leg that reports anything. One consequence
  # is worth knowing when reading the tests: the completeness oracle in
  # hack/promote-rewrite-tags_test.bats builds its expected side with
  # collect_refs_from_file, so for this file that comparison is inert -- it can
  # neither fail nor pass on it. What pins the multus entry against the real tree
  # is `image_ref_files enumerates all three storage shapes` for the path and
  # `collect_image_refs finds refs the depth-2 values.yaml glob misses` for the
  # ref, both in that same file.
