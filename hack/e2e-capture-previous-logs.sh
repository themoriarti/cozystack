#!/bin/sh
# e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh - dump the PREVIOUS container instance's logs for
# every container that has restarted.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC ONLY. This runs on an already-failed test, never mutates the
# cluster, and never changes the test's pass/fail outcome. Every kubectl call is
# individually time-boxed and every failure is swallowed.
#
# Why this exists: when a pod crash-loops, the decisive evidence is almost
# always in the immediately preceding terminated instance -- the interrupted
# bootstrap, the assertion that killed the process, the config error that made
# the entrypoint exit. `kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>` only ever shows the
# CURRENT instance, which for a crash-looping container is the Nth restart: a
# fresh, uninformative replay of the same startup path. That instance is
# reachable only via `--previous`, and once the kubelet garbage-collects that
# dead container the evidence is gone for good.
#
# The Chainsaw suites capture current logs through the built-in `podLogs`
# collector, which has no `previous` option in chainsaw v0.2.15, so this
# closes that gap for every suite at once
# from the global catch rather than per-suite. The crust-gather snapshot does
# collect previous.log per container, but that is a whole archive to download
# and `crust-gather serve`; this puts the decisive lines directly in the failed
# job's log, and keeps them even when the snapshot is truncated.
#
# Selection is discovered at runtime, never hardcoded: any container (including
# init containers -- an interrupted bootstrap lives there) whose restartCount is
# greater than zero. Containers that never restarted are skipped, so the common
# healthy case emits nothing at all rather than a page of "previous terminated
# container not found" noise.
#
# Usage: e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh <output-dir> [preferred-namespace]
#
# Environment:
#   COZY_PREVLOG_MAX   max containers to dump (default 12); the overflow count
#                      is logged, never silently dropped. Raising it past ~13
#                      trades one bounded report for another: the callers wrap
#                      this script in a 300s backstop and the worst case is
#                      ~30s for the pod list plus 20s per container, so beyond
#                      that the backstop starts cutting the capture instead of
#                      the cap reporting it. Widen the callers' backstop too.
#   COZY_PREVLOG_TAIL  lines per container (default 200).
