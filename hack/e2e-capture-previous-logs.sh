# e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh - dump the PREVIOUS container instance's logs for
# every container that has restarted.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC ONLY. This runs on an already-failed test, never mutates the
# cluster, and never changes the test's pass/fail outcome. Every failure is
# swallowed, and every kubectl call is individually time-boxed when `timeout` is
# on PATH -- when it is not, the reads run unbounded rather than not at all, a
# line says so, and the caller's outer backstop is what bounds them.
#
# Why this exists: when a pod crash-loops, the decisive evidence is almost
# always in the immediately preceding terminated instance -- the interrupted
# bootstrap, the assertion that killed the process, the config error that made
# the entrypoint exit. `kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>` only ever shows the
# CURRENT instance, which for a crash-looping container is the Nth restart: a
# fresh, uninformative replay of the same startup path. That instance is
# reachable only via `--previous`, and once the kubelet garbage-collects that
# dead container the evidence is gone for good.
#
# The Chainsaw suites capture current logs through the built-in `podLogs`
# collector, which has no `previous` option in chainsaw v0.2.15, so this
# closes that gap for every suite at once
# from the global catch rather than per-suite. The crust-gather snapshot does
# collect previous.log per container, but that is a whole archive to download
# and `crust-gather serve`; this puts the decisive lines directly in the failed
# job's log, and keeps them even when the snapshot is truncated.
#
# Selection is discovered at runtime, never hardcoded: any container (including
# init containers -- an interrupted bootstrap lives there) whose restartCount is
# greater than zero. Containers that never restarted are skipped, so the common
# healthy case costs one line saying nothing restarted, rather than a page of
# "previous terminated container not found" noise. That one line is written, not
# omitted: an absent capture-notes.txt is indistinguishable from a capture that
# never ran.
#
# Usage: e2e-capture-previous-logs.sh <output-dir> [preferred-namespace]
#
# Environment:
#   COZY_PREVLOG_MAX   max containers to dump (default 12); the overflow count
#                      goes to the job log and to <output-dir>/capture-notes.txt,
#                      never silently dropped. Raising it past ~13
#                      trades one bounded report for another: the callers wrap
#                      this script in a 300s backstop and the worst case is
#                      ~30s for the pod list plus 20s per container, so beyond
#                      that the backstop starts cutting the capture instead of
#                      the cap reporting it. Widen the callers' backstop too.
#   COZY_PREVLOG_TAIL  lines per container (default 200). The bound each capture
#                      was written under is named in capture-notes.txt beside the
#                      logs, not inside them: --tail drops the OLDEST lines and
#                      nothing in the output says so, but a log read in full is a
#                      complete artifact and a trailing prose line breaks every
#                      parser that could read it before. -1 asks for
#                      the whole log and suppresses that note, since no bound was
#                      applied. A malformed value, a zero, or a leading zero falls
#                      back to 200 and says so in capture-notes.txt: --tail=0 asks
#                      kubectl for nothing, which this script would otherwise
#                      report as the container having logged nothing, and a leading
#                      zero is octal to `$(( ))` and decimal to `[`.

  # still emits a warning is the one shape where dropping the message costs most:
  # the branch below then reports "produced no output", which is a positive claim
  # about the container made while kubectl was speaking. The refusal path keeps its
  # own handling further down; this copy is about preserving what was said, whatever
