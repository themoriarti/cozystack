#!/usr/bin/env bats
# Tests for hack/promote-retag.sh — the rc->stable retag selector.
#
# Guards the regression where collect_refs scraped *every* @sha256 ref from the
# package values.yaml — including third-party images (docker.io/clastix/kubectl,
# ghcr.io/kvaps/...), bare upstream tags (kube-ovn/keycloak/kilo) and a
# "--migrate-image=..." arg string — so the first skopeo copy to a registry CI
# cannot push to aborted the whole promotion. The selector must emit only
# cozystack-owned ($REGISTRY/...) refs.
#
# Harness note: the CI path is hack/cozytest.sh, NOT real bats. cozytest.sh's
# awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its own line; there
# is no `run`, `$status`, `$output`, `skip`, or setup()/teardown(). Each test
# runs as a shell function under `set -eu -x`, so a non-zero exit aborts the
# test (that is the exit-0 assertion) and other expectations are direct shell
# tests. A test that expects a non-zero exit must capture it with `|| rc=$?`
# so the harness's `set -e` does not abort first. mikefarah yq is assumed
# present (provided by the test toolchain, like the other yq-using bats here).
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/promote-retag_test.bats
#           (or `bats hack/promote-retag_test.bats` if the bats binary is
#           installed; cozytest.sh is the CI path.)
