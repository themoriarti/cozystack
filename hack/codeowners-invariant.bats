# Coverage invariant for .github/CODEOWNERS.
#
# CODEOWNERS applies only the LAST matching rule, and matching is not
# additive: a scoped rule fully replaces the * catch-all instead of extending
# it. The only way to keep the default owners able to review everything is to
# repeat their handles in every scoped rule. A rule that omits one of them
# silently carves its path out from under the catch-all, and since "Require
# review from Code Owners" is enforced on main and stale reviews are dismissed
# on push, that path then deadlocks whenever its remaining owners are away,
# with no way around it short of an admin override.
#
# The invariant: every rule that lists owners must include every owner of the
# * catch-all. Ownerless rules are the one exception, being generated files
# whose review is waived on purpose.
#
# Changing the catch-all owners is a policy change; this test failing on such
# a change is the point - adjust the expectation here in the same PR, with the
# policy discussion linked.
