# Unit test: the redis ResourceDefinition hands tenants the key-free trust
# anchor and nothing else.
#
# The chart issues redis-<name>.ca-tls (CA certificate AND CA private key, the
# latter under tls.key) and redis-<name>.tls (server certificate AND server
# private key). Neither may reach a tenant: read access to the CA key would
# let the holder issue certificates for anything rather than merely verify the
# server. What a client actually needs is ca.crt alone, delivered by the
# CA-extraction controller as the key-free <release>.tenant-ca projection and
# selected by LABEL rather than by name, because a name grant conveys whatever
# happens to occupy that name.
#
# Redis has a third Secret the other engines do not: redis-<name>.ca-cert, the
# CA-only copy the patched operator publishes for itself. It is key-free today,
# which is exactly why it is tempting to grant by name — and why it is not.
# The operator holds create and update on Secrets cluster-wide, so what lands
# under that name is the operator's choice rather than the platform's, and RBAC
# has no key-level filter to fall back on.
#
# Asserted against the RENDERED chart, not against cozyrds/redis.yaml on
# disk. templates/cozyrd.yaml globs cozyrds/* and emits each match through
# .Files.Get, so what ships is the render: reading one source file would miss
# a second file in that directory, and a dotfile the glob picks up. Helm
# ignores dotfiles only under templates/, so one here does ship.
#
# This lives in bats rather than helm-unittest because packages/system/
# redis-rd has no `test:` target, and hack/helm-unit-tests.sh skips any
# package without one. If that package ever grows one, this belongs there.
#
# spec.secrets is compared WHOLE rather than probed for known-bad names.
# Three ways this breaks are invisible to a name-by-name check:
#
#   - a name added under a different spelling, or via a helper;
#   - an include with NO resourceNames and NO matchLabels, which restricts
#     nothing;
#   - a SECOND matchLabels include selecting a label the key-bearing Secrets
#     also carry. cert-manager stamps controller.cert-manager.io/fao on the
#     Secrets it creates, both of these among them, so one such entry grants
#     the CA private key while every name in the file stays correct.
