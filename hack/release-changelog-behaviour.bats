#!/usr/bin/env bats
# EXECUTES the release-changelog logic instead of asserting about its YAML.
#
# Its companion, hack/release-changelog-contract.bats, greps the workflow files.
# That catches a rename or a deleted `if:`, and nothing else: it cannot tell
# whether the shell inside a `run:` block does what the step name claims, and it
# stays green while the logic underneath is wrong. Everything here runs for real
# against throwaway git repositories and asserts on outcomes.
#
# What is genuinely covered:
#
#   * hack/changelog-preserve.sh against real remotes — a branch that exists, one
#     that does not, one with no changelog, one with an empty changelog, and the
#     full force-push cycle promote actually performs.
#   * hack/validate-changelog.sh against every current-era changelog in the tree
#     plus hand-built truncated / wrong-version / whitespace inputs.
#   * finalize's release-body selection, executed under node with the same inputs
#     the workflow gives it.
#   * The GitHub Actions `needs` + `if:` semantics the whole non-blocking design
#     rests on, run under `act` when Docker is available (see
#     hack/testdata/needs-semantics.yaml).
#
# Still NOT covered, and worth saying plainly:
#
#   * The AI generation step. Unobservable without Copilot and a paid run.
#   * The real GitHub API calls — gh pr create/edit, updateRelease. Only their
#     surrounding shell is exercised.
#   * That the sparse tooling checkout resolves on GitHub's runners. actions/
#     checkout is not runnable here; the contract suite pins its presence.
