# Invariant for the package `update` recipes that clear templates/ wholesale.
#
# `update` refetches a package's vendored upstream manifests, and several
# recipes open by deleting templates/ to guarantee a clean slate. That is safe
# only while every file under templates/ comes back from the recipe.
# templates/ is an ordinary chart directory, so a package can also keep
# first-party manifests there, and the recipe knows nothing about them. The
# wipe takes them and `make update` exits 0, so the deletion lands in the diff
# with nothing marking it. Whether anything downstream notices depends on the
# package carrying a helm-unittest suite that names the file, and where none
# does the loss is silent all the way to a cluster. That is a property of the
# package, not of the tree, so it is worth re-deriving rather than reading: at
# the time of writing kubevirt-cdi has such a suite and a deletion there fails
# `make test` as well, while some packages that clear their own templates/
# declare no `test` target at all (#3631 tracks packages without one).
#
# The invariant: a recipe that clears templates/ must NAME every file tracked
# under it. Both halves are approximations of the shell the recipe would run,
# and each is argued at its helper below: the wipe is a text match over the
# recipe's lines rather than a parse, and "names" means the file's basename
# minus its extension appears somewhere in the Makefile -- a mention, not proof
# of a write. What that catches is the shape kubevirt-cdi had, a file the
# Makefile does not refer to at all: every recipe that clears its own
# templates/ writes each path it puts back there, so a name appearing nowhere
# in the file is a name nothing refetches. A recipe that unpacked an archive or
# globbed a stream into templates/ would produce files it never names and break
# that reading. cert-manager's `mv charts/.../crd-*.yaml` is that shape, and it
# is out of range for the separate reason below: the directory it fills belongs
# to another package.
#
# The tree is scanned rather than a list of packages pinned, so a package that
# grows its first first-party manifest under a wiping recipe of its own is
# caught by the commit that adds it, within the reach the next two paragraphs
# mark out. The packages that clear their own templates/ today refetch all of
# it, which is what keeps this green.
#
# What that leaves uncovered is a recipe clearing SOMEONE ELSE'S templates/, and
# the tree has one: packages/system/cert-manager/Makefile runs
# `rm -rf ../cert-manager-crds/templates/*` and moves the CRDs it pulled into
# that directory, while cert-manager-crds declares no update target at all. A
# first-party manifest added there is deleted by the next `make update` in
# cert-manager and nothing below reports it. Covering that means resolving the
# removal's target directory rather than reading the wiping package's own, which
# is a second helper; the pattern below is deliberately not widened to accept a
# path prefix, because that alone would fire on cert-manager and then list the
# templates of a directory it does not have -- the removal names the sibling's
# path, so the lookup has to follow it.
#
# Two more places are out of reach because the scan reads only the text of a
# package's own `update:` recipe. One is a removal made elsewhere: in a
# prerequisite target, behind an include, or behind a recursive make.
# capi-operator, clustersecret-operator, openbao and reloader all write
# `update: clean <name>-update` and take both of those recipes from
# hack/package.mk, which removes nothing under templates/ today; a removal
# added there would go unreported for all four. The other is a Makefile the
# glob does not reach: it stops at packages/*/*/, and the two vendored kamaji
# subcharts below that level declare no `update` target today.
#
# The scan alone would also be green against a detector that finds nothing, so
# the control below runs the same two helpers over a fixture that does hold an
# unrefetched file, and over that fixture with the removal taken out.
#
# Constraints from cozytest.sh: it rewrites the closing brace of every function
# in this file into `return 0`, so a helper cannot report through its exit
# status -- both report through stdout -- and it injects `set -e`, so statuses
# are captured explicitly.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/package-update-templates.bats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prints the recipe line that clears templates/ wholesale, for a package
# Makefile whose `update` target has one. Silent otherwise, including for a
# Makefile with no `update` target at all.
#
# The recipe is read the way make reads one: the run of tab-indented lines after
# `update:`, with blank lines and comment lines passed over rather than treated
# as its end, because make ignores them and carries on. A tab-indented comment
# is skipped rather than searched, which matters more here than anywhere else in
# the file: a recipe that deliberately does not clear templates/ is likely to
# carry a line saying why, and without the skip
# `# deliberately no rm -rf templates here` reads as a wipe and fails that very
# package. Both helpers drop comments before searching, for mirror-image
# reasons. The terminator class accepts a following space or `;` and nothing
# else, because `templates &&` already matches through the space and
# `templates&` is a shape nobody writes.
#
# The match accepts `rm -rf`, `rm -fr` and `rm -r` against `templates` and
# `./templates`, bare, with a trailing slash, or with a `/*` glob -- the three
# spellings that empty the directory. It deliberately does not accept
# `rm -rf templates/one-file.yml`, which takes a single file the recipe goes on
# to refetch (rabbitmq-operator), nor a narrower glob such as
# `rm -rf templates/*.yaml`, which takes a subset the same way.
#
# It is a text match and not a shell parse, so a quoted `rm -rf "templates"`, a
# removal reached through a variable, a `find -delete` and a `cd` into another
# directory first are all invisible to it. So is `rm -rf templates&& mkdir`,
# where the removal runs straight into `&&` with no space: legal shell, and
# outside the terminator class. So is a path-prefixed target -- the
# cert-manager case in the header is one, and the prefix is the only thing
# keeping it out, since the `/*` it ends with is accepted. The enumeration is
# only as complete as the last reader made it, so extend it in the same edit as
# the pattern.
#
# A second `update:` can fool this in either direction: make runs the last
# recipe, this reads whichever ones are adjacent. Nothing in the tree writes
# one.

# Prints every file tracked under a package's templates/ that its Makefile
# never mentions, one path per line. Whether that matters is the caller's call:
# it matters for a package whose recipe clears the directory, and for no other.
#
# The listing is the index, so only a tracked file is at stake -- it is the one
# the next `make update` deletes out from under a reviewer who has no reason to
# look. Reading the working tree instead would fail a package over the
# developer's own litter: an untracked .orig from a hand-applied patch, a
# half-written template, a .DS_Store. A guard that goes red on scratch files is
# a guard that gets switched off.
#
# The extension is stripped before matching, because a recipe may assemble the
# filename from a variable holding the bare stem -- etcd-operator-crds writes
# templates/$$c.yaml from a CRDS list of names without one. A basename whose
# only dot is its first character keeps the whole name instead: stripping there
# leaves the empty string, which grep matches against every Makefile, and the
# file would pass without being looked at. The search covers the whole Makefile
# rather than the recipe alone for the same reason as the stem: the variable is
# assigned above the target. Both make the match generous, so a stem that
# appears for any other reason satisfies it. Two live examples in the tree
# today. A sibling's name: gateway-api-crds clears templates/ and writes
# templates/crds-experimental.yaml, so a templates/crds.yaml added beside it
# passes because `crds` is inside that name. And a word used elsewhere in the
# file: objectstorage-controller clears templates/ and writes only
# templates/controller.yaml, yet a templates/sidecar.yaml would pass, since its
# image targets say `sidecar` several times. This reports the files nothing in
# the Makefile refers to, not every file the recipe fails to write.
#
# Comment lines are dropped before the search, so a filename written into one is
# not a mention: a rationale comment above a recipe, naming the very file it is
# about, would otherwise exempt that package from its own guard. Comments
# naming a template are not rare in the tree, so this is the difference between
# a package being read and a package being taken at its word.
#
# The NAME and NAMESPACE assignments go the same way. They are the package's
# identity rather than a reference to any file, and a package called foo-bar
# whose recipe writes templates/bar.yaml has that file's stem inside its own
# name: left in, they let a package vouch for its own templates without any
# recipe touching them. The match is on the variable name and not on the
# assignment operator, because the hole does not care how it was spelled: the
# `export` prefix is optional and so is whitespace either side. The cases below
# pin the export prefix and the `:=` spelling, which with the bare `NAME=` are
# every form the tree writes; the pattern is looser than that on purpose, and
# the looseness beyond those forms is not something a case here checks.
#
# Two names are named rather than a `[A-Z_]+=` shape for the opposite reason:
# a variable holding content is what the whole-file search is there to find,
# and etcd-operator-crds names its templates through nothing but its CRDS
# list, so a shape that broad would be one unspaced assignment away from
# blinding the scan to five CRDs. That list is written spaced, which is why
# the broader pattern would not reach it today and why no case below can pin
# this choice; two names cannot reach it at any spacing. No package the scan
# reaches is exempted this way today; the exclusion is for the first one that
# would be.
