#!/usr/bin/env bats
# Guards the "Downstream Repositories" trigger map in docs/agents/contributing.md.
#
# The map tells a contributor which change in this repo forces a follow-up in a
# satellite repository. Each trigger names a file on this side: hack/update-crd.sh,
# packages/core/platform/values.yaml, and so on. Rename one of those and the map
# keeps confidently pointing at a path that no longer exists, from inside the PR
# template, to every reader. The repository list is deliberately not restated here
# — it would be one more copy to drift; the map and the PR template are the two
# sources, and the tests below hold them to each other.
#
# The three tests pin, in order: every in-repo path the map cites to a file that
# exists; the workflow guarantee that Bats contracts run on every docs-only PR;
# and the map and the PR-template checklist to the same repository list, so a
# repository cannot be listed in one and forgotten in the other.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, so nobody mistakes a green tick for a correct map:
#
#   * Whether a trigger is TRUE. "Change X here and Y breaks over there" is a
#     claim about a satellite repo. Verifying it needs that repo checked out at
#     a known ref, which this suite deliberately does not do: a unit test must
#     not depend on the network or on six sibling clones. A trigger can cite a
#     path that exists here and still describe a coupling that is nonsense.
#   * Anything on the satellite side. A file named there (its Makefile, its
#     scripts/, its playbooks) is not reachable from this repo and is not
#     validated. Those names are exactly where the map is most likely to rot.
#   * Whether the map is COMPLETE. Deleting a whole trigger, or a whole block of
#     them, passes: the repository-list test compares section headings, not bodies.
#   * A path written without backticks. Extraction keys off `code spans`, which
#     is the section's convention; a lone unquoted path slips through. Stripping
#     the backticks wholesale does fail, via the anti-vacuum guard below.
#
# In short: this catches a rename on THIS side, which is the cheap half. The
# expensive half — is the coupling real, and is it still real over there — stays
# a human's job, and reviewers should not assume CI did it for them.
#
# A docs-only PR skips builds and E2E, but the `checks` job still runs the Bats
# lane. Otherwise editing this map, or another document audited by a unit
# contract, would exempt the changed input from its own guard.
