# Unit tests for hack/seaweedfs-naming-audit.sh.
#
# The chart's naming guard refuses whenever both naming generations exist, so the
# audit IS the classifier — it is what an operator acts on, and acting on it
# deletes PVCs. Two earlier revisions of this classification shipped as an
# untested shell snippet inside the runbook, and both were wrong in ways that
# routed a live tenant into the step that strands its data:
#
#   - a selector `^data1-(.*seaweedfs.*)-volume` also matched the CHART-named
#     claims, so the release-named age range spanned both generations, every
#     tenant read as "ranges overlap / mid-rebind", and a genuine S-damaged tenant
#     was routed AWAY from Step 2a (which would have been correct) into Step 2,
#     which deletes its data claim;
#   - matching claims by name with `grep seaweedfs` cannot see a long instance
#     name, whose claims the chart truncates past `seaweedfs`, so such a tenant
#     read as "L — nothing to do" while the chart refused it.
#
# Moving the classifier into a file with tests is the point. These drive it
# against a fake kubectl, mocking only the cluster boundary.
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its own
# line; there is no bats `run`/`$status`/`setup`.

# Fail-closed tests (issue #3431).
#
# The classification tests above mock nothing below the classifier. These drive
# the KUBECTL layer, where the fail-open bug lived: a kubectl call that failed
# used to return empty stdout, byte-identical to a genuinely clean fleet, so the
# audit printed an empty table and exited 0 -- the exact false "nothing to do" the
# operator is told to trust before deleting PVCs. They shim `kubectl` on PATH with
# a fake and assert the audit fails LOUDLY (non-zero exit + a FATAL naming the
# query) on any real error, while still treating a genuinely-absent object as
# clean. Two families:
#
#   * enumerating LISTs (get ns / secret / pvc / sts) -- a failure is always fatal;
#   * by-NAME GETs (a release secret in system_releases, a PVC/PV in pv_epoch) --
#     `--ignore-not-found` splits a real error (fatal) from a legitimate absence:
#     an absent release revision is a clean skip; an absent PV degrades to the
#     safe "cannot establish direction" note and must NOT become a deletion
#     candidate (the range-narrowing flip Codex reproduced).
#
# The two golden tests guard the reverse: on a healthy cluster the output stays
# byte-for-byte what it was on origin/main, including the MIXED path that exercises
# every pv_epoch GET.
#
# The fake is a real executable on PATH, so it exercises the actual exit-status
# handling in run_kubectl and the propagation up through every caller -- a for
# loop over `$(...)` swallows the status, so this is where a regression would hide.

# _release_blob [chart-name] -- the value kubectl returns for a Helm release
# secret's `.data.release`: base64(base64(gzip(json))). release_json base64-decodes
# twice and gunzips it, and system_releases reads the chart name from
# chart.metadata.name (as real Helm payloads carry it). Defaults to a cozy-seaweedfs
# release so the audit confirms the tenant; pass another chart name for a non-
# SeaweedFS release, or the literal EMPTY for a chartless {} payload.
#
# Three payload SHAPES beyond the default compact one, because the chart-name
# extraction is now fatal on a miss and every shape below is something a
# re-serializer or a user's values could produce:
#   SPACED  whitespace around the JSON punctuation (json.dumps' default)
#   PRETTY  indented and MULTI-LINE (jq . / yq -o=json), which a line-based
#           matcher cannot read at all unless newlines are folded first
#   DECOY   a real cozy-seaweedfs chart PLUS a values subtree that spells
#           chart.metadata.name with a different value. Helm marshals "config"
#           (the values) AFTER "chart", so a last-match extraction returns the
#           decoy and silently declares the tenant non-SeaweedFS.
