# Unit tests for platform migration 54 --> 55 (adopt every existing
# RedisFailover onto the freshworks-oss redis-operator's group filter AND pin
# its engine, before the new operator starts).
#
# redis-operator v3.3.5 watches RedisFailovers through a server-side label
# selector (redis-failover.freshworks.com/operator-group=cozystack); a CR
# without that label never reaches the operator's informer. The same window is
# dangerous for the engine version: v3.3.5's compiled-in default moved
# 6.2.6 -> 7.2.4, which rewrites dump.rdb into a format 6.2.6 cannot load. So the
# migration, in one pass ahead of the new operator, ALWAYS stamps the label and
# pins spec.redis.image / spec.sentinel.image to redis:6.2.6-alpine ONLY where
# that field is empty — leaving a preset image (apps/redis pins its data image
# via versionMap) untouched.
#
# Three properties are pinned here:
#
#  1. FAIL CLOSED ON THE PROBE. `kubectl get crd ... --ignore-not-found -o name`
#     separates a genuinely absent CRD (rc 0, empty -> nothing to adopt, stamp
#     and exit) from a real apiserver error (rc != 0 -> abort under
#     set -euo pipefail). A one-off blip read as "absent" would stamp the
#     version and leave the whole fleet unlabelled and invisible to the new
#     operator, permanently — the exact failure this migration exists to
#     prevent.
#
#  2. LABEL ALWAYS, PIN ONLY WHERE EMPTY. Every adopted CR's patch carries the
#     operator-group label. The engine pin is added only for a role whose image
#     is empty: a both-empty CR (Harbor) gets both images pinned; a
#     sentinel-only-empty CR (apps/redis, redis.image preset) gets ONLY the
#     sentinel pinned and its preset redis.image is never overwritten; a
#     fully-preset CR gets the label and no pin at all.
#
#  3. FAIL CLOSED ON THE PATCH. Migrations never re-run, so a swallowed patch
#     error would stamp the version on a half-adopted fleet and never look back.
#     A failed patch must abort BEFORE stamping so the Job retries.
#
# These drive the real migration script end-to-end against a fake kubectl
# (hack/testdata/migration-54-redis/), mocking only the cluster boundary.
#
# SHELL. Production runs migration 54 under /bin/sh = busybox ash: the migrations
# image is FROM alpine and run-migrations.sh execs `/migrations/<n>` BY PATH, so
# the kernel honours the `#!/bin/sh` shebang. `set -euo pipefail` and its
# errexit semantics differ from bash, and pipefail is load-bearing: the fleet
# scan pipes `kubectl ... -o json` into jq. So run_migration() runs the script by
# path inside the image's own pinned base rather than through a host shell — same
# base image, same interpreter, same invocation form.
#
# jq. Migration 54 pipes through jq (fleet scan, per-CR image read, patch
# construction). The raw alpine base ships without it while the built migrations
# image installs it via `apk add`, so prep() bakes jq onto the pinned base once
# (the only step that touches the network) and run_migration() uses that image,
# still --network none.
#
# CI runs this file under Bats through `make bats-unit-tests`. It also remains
# compatible with the legacy `hack/cozytest.sh` translator, whose awk parser
# rewrites a bare `}` into `return 0` plus `}`. The tests avoid `run`, `$status`,
# and setup() for that path. A helper whose status matters captures and returns
# it before its closing brace so the injected return cannot mask it.
#
