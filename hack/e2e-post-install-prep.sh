# Runs LINSTOR pool + StorageClass + MetalLB pool configuration as soon as
# their respective prerequisites are reachable. Designed to run in the
# background during the platform HR reconcile wait, so its wall-clock cost
# overlaps with the wait instead of compounding it.
#
# Each LINSTOR prerequisite below sits at the end of a multi-hop reconcile
# chain: cozystack-operator -> platform HR -> linstor HR -> piraeus-operator
# -> cert-manager issues the controller TLS -> linstor-controller Deployment
# -> controller pod -> DB migration. On a loaded CI runner that chain has been
# observed to take 7-9 min end to end, and the operator alone needs ~70s just
# to emit the linstor HR. The earlier per-step "object exists" budgets
# (timeout 60 / timeout 300) were anchored to this script's start, so they
# raced that reconcile latency; when one lost (linstor HR appeared at ~+70s
# against a 60s budget) `set -e` aborted the whole script and the install
# failed. So every wait below tolerates a not-yet-created object without
# aborting, and each gets its own budget, started when the link before it
# completed rather than when this script did -- the same shape the LINSTOR
# node and MetalLB CRD waits further down already have.
#
# One budget shared by the whole chain instead fails the install whenever the
# chain merely runs long, because the head of it eats the window and the tail
# inherits the remainder. Both halves were observed inside a single 15m window
# on one run: the linstor HR went Ready 452s in, and the Deployment needed a
# further ~520s because the controller's DB migration lost its connection to
# the apiserver and retried four times before succeeding. Neither figure is
# anomalous and neither exceeds the budget on its own; only their sum did, and
# the install failed naming the Deployment as though it were broken.
#
# What a per-link budget buys is not speed but a guarantee: every link gets its
# whole allowance no matter what the links ahead of it spent, so the tail of the
# chain can no longer be failed by the head merely being slow. Detecting a link
# that is genuinely stuck does not get faster, and for the second link it gets
# slower, because its budget starts when the first one finished: a Deployment
# that never converges is reported later by however long the HelmRelease took.
# A first link that never becomes Ready is reported at the same moment as
# before, since its budget still starts with the script.
#
# The cost is the ceiling: two waits at LINK_BUDGET each put the worst case at
# twice that figure rather than once, ahead of the 300s node wait, the 600s
# StorageProfile wait in container mode and the 300s MetalLB wait below, plus
# the bound on each call that does work, and still well inside the timeout the
# job carries.

# Polls `kubectl wait` until it succeeds or this link's budget elapses. The
# name says linstor because the timeout diagnostics below read cozy-linstor
# unconditionally: the wait itself is generic over its kubectl arguments, but
# what it dumps on the way out is not, and a caller elsewhere would get the
# wrong namespace's pods presented as evidence.
# kubectl wait exits non-zero immediately when the object does not exist yet,
# so the loop tolerates "not created yet" without the set -e cliff that a bare
# `kubectl wait` would trigger on a NotFound. The per-attempt timeout shrinks
# to the budget remaining, so the final attempt can consume the rest of it.
# The outer `timeout` sits above that: --timeout covers only the watch, not the
# GET that resolves the object first, which has no deadline of its own.
# An expired credential or an RBAC denial exits the same way, and only the
# text tells them apart, so stderr is kept and printed whenever it changes:
# once for a NotFound repeated every poll, and again when the cause changes.
# It is printed rather than matched to fail fast, because apiserver restarts
# during install produce the same connection and auth errors transiently.
