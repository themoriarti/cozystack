# Unit test: mongodb-rd cozyrds must deliver the TLS trust anchor without
# private key material.
#
# The PSMDB operator creates <release>-ca-cert holding the CA PRIVATE KEY and
# <release>-ssl / <release>-ssl-internal holding server private keys. The tenant
# must receive only the key-free <release>.tenant-ca projection, reached by
# label. These names are the contract between this file and the operator, and
# nothing else in the repo checks them at this level.
#
# The declaration that names the extraction source is a TenantProjection the
# chart renders, covered by packages/apps/mongodb/tests/tenant_projection_test.yaml.
