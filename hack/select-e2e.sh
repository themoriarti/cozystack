# Output:
#   - empty         no E2E impact, decided by one of the rules that select
#                   nothing: step 1 for docs/, dashboards/ and *.md, step 2 for
#                   a *.disabled Chainsaw suite and for an
#                   examples/backups/<app>/ with no suite, and
#                   inert_config_pattern for repo meta and agent config
#   - <suite names> selected per the PackageSource dependency graph
#   - full list     any path that affects all tests, OR an unrecognised
#                   packages/* path, OR a changed package that reaches no
#                   runnable suite through the graph, OR a path matching NEITHER
#                   the full-suite nor the inert list, OR a yq that failed to
#                   build the dependency graph (conservative fallbacks)
#   - nothing, and  the suite list itself is unavailable: find failed, or
#     a non-zero    hack/e2e-chainsaw holds no chainsaw-test.yaml. Unlike the
#     exit          yq case there is no fallback left to take — an empty list
#                   silently corrupts both the escalations, which would print
#                   it, and the backups rule, which membership-tests against
#                   it — so the script refuses to answer at all, and since both
#                   lanes run it under `bash -e` the step fails
#
# Every changed path must land in exactly one of the three selection classes by
# an explicit rule; the fourth outcome is not a classification but a refusal to
# produce one. An unclassified path escalates to the full suite rather than
# selecting nothing: both e2e lanes read an empty selection as "skip Chainsaw"
# and then post the required "E2E Tests" status green, so a silent default is a
# green gate with no suite run (#3392). When that escalation fires for a path
# that genuinely cannot affect e2e, add it to inert_config_pattern — do not
# widen the fall-through.
#
# "Empty" is not a synonym for inert_config_pattern. Several rules select
# nothing: step 1 for docs/, dashboards/ and *.md, step 2 for a *.disabled
# Chainsaw suite and for an examples/backups/<app>/ whose app has no suite, and
# the pattern itself. The property the lanes depend on is weaker than "matched
# the inert list" and it is the one to preserve: an empty selection is a
# decision some rule reached, never a path nothing looked at.
#
# One caveat worth knowing before trusting that: inert_config_pattern makes
# .github/ inert as a whole directory, and the e2e workflows are exempted by
# NAME in full_suite_pattern, which is checked first. So a workflow added under
# .github/workflows/ that runs the suite is silently inert until someone adds it
# to that list — the fall-through never sees it. The enumeration is the guard,
# which is why it carries the `rg -l test-chainsaw` reminder; treat that comment
# as load-bearing rather than decorative.

# Anything matching this pattern triggers the full Chainsaw suite. Per-suite
# edits (hack/e2e-chainsaw/<name>/...) are matched BEFORE this so editing one
# suite doesn't escalate to the full suite; the shared _lib helpers and the
# .chainsaw.yaml config affect every suite and DO escalate (handled inline).
#
# Three groups, all "cannot be scoped to one app":
#   - shipped code and its build inputs: packages/library, packages/core, the Go
#     trees (api, cmd, internal, pkg), the codegen under tools/, go.mod/go.sum,
#     the root Makefile, hack/*.mk (the tag/push/output flags of every image),
#     hack/buildkitd.toml (the builder every image is built with), and hack/lib/
#     (sourced by the hack/*.sh scripts that already escalate);
#   - the e2e harness itself: hack/*.sh, hack/*.bats and hack/e2e-*.yaml;
#   - the workflows that RUN the suite — enumerated rather than matched by
#     prefix, so an unrelated workflow does not burn a full run. Keep this list
#     in step with `rg -l test-chainsaw .github/workflows/`.
#
#     What that costs, stated rather than left to be rediscovered: only
#     pull-requests.yaml is executed from the PR's own head. e2e-fork runs on
#     workflow_run, which always takes the default-branch copy; e2e-tag runs on
#     workflow_call from a tag push; nightly runs on a schedule. So for those
#     three the suite cannot exercise the edit under review, and escalating buys
#     generic regression coverage rather than coverage of the change. Measured
#     over the last six months of main: 26 commits touch one of the three with
#     no other escalating path, and each now pays a full Chainsaw run it would
#     previously have skipped. They stay on the list so the rule remains one
#     idea ("workflows that run the suite") rather than two, and because the
#     alternative leaves them inert, which reads as an oversight rather than a
#     decision. Reopen the trade if the full suite's flake rate makes the
#     generic coverage cost more than it returns.
