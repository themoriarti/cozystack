# Regression coverage for the tenant-worker CPU throttling capture in
# hack/e2e-chainsaw/_lib/run-kubernetes.sh. cozytest.sh ends an @test block at
# the first bare closing brace, so command mocks stay at top level.
#
# What this capture answers, and why nothing else in the tree answers it: when
# a worker misses the node-Ready deadline, the sandbox node it runs on is
# routinely half idle while the guest makes no progress. Node-level utilisation
# and the node's dmesg both look healthy in that state, so "the host was
# starved" and "the VM was held at its own CFS ceiling" produce the same
# evidence from outside. Only the container's own throttling counters separate
# them, and a capture that reports an unread kubelet as a quiet one would hand
# the next reader the same ambiguity while looking like it had resolved it.
# These tests pin the separation, not the reading.
