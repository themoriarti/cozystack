# migration-controller

Reconciles `forklift.cozystack.io`: `VMImportSource` connections and the `VMImportTask` operations that run over them. Konveyor Forklift is the transfer engine underneath; this controller owns the tenant-facing API, drives Forklift's objects, and turns each finished transfer into a Cozystack `VMDisk` and `VMInstance`.

Opt-in. Add all three packages to `bundles.enabledPackages`:

```yaml
bundles:
  enabledPackages:
  - cozystack.forklift-operator
  - cozystack.forklift
  - cozystack.migration-controller
```

## Before the first import

Four checks, each of which otherwise fails late and obscurely. All were hit on a real cluster.

1. **The storage class must bind `Immediate`.** A `WaitForFirstConsumer` class deadlocks an import: nothing consumes the claim while it is being populated. The task refuses such a class up front rather than hanging, but the *cluster default* is frequently `WaitForFirstConsumer`, so `spec.storageClass` usually has to be named explicitly. Check with `kubectl get storageclass`.
2. **The ESXi host must be reachable, and must not collide with the Service CIDR.** See [When the cluster cannot reach the ESXi host](#when-the-cluster-cannot-reach-the-esxi-host). This is the one that costs a whole transfer before it announces itself.
3. **The vCenter account needs its domain.** `mtv-migration` is rejected as an incorrect username; `mtv-migration@vsphere.local` is not. The engine reports it as a credentials failure either way, which reads like the wrong password.
4. **The engine's own certificates must be current.** Forklift rotates its serving certificates and updates the secret, but does not restart its pods, so a long-lived deployment can serve a certificate its own published CA no longer matches. The controller verifies that CA and will refuse the connection. `kubectl -n cozy-forklift rollout restart deploy/forklift-controller` resolves it; the same staleness eventually expires the certificate outright.

## Platform configuration

One key, and only for VMware:

```yaml
vmImport:
  vddkImage: registry.example.com/vddk:8.0.3
```

Cozystack neither ships nor mirrors that image: it is built from VMware's proprietary Virtual Disk Development Kit, which we have no licence to redistribute. An operator who holds one builds it, pushes it where the cluster can pull from, and names it here. Only the reference travels to the controller — never a credential.

Leaving it empty is a normal, supported state. A vSphere `VMImportSource` then reports `Ready=False` with reason `VDDKNotConfigured` at the moment it is created, so a tenant learns the path is unavailable at registration rather than watching a transfer die halfway through. Nothing is materialized for such a source — not even its credentials Secret.

## What a tenant creates

A connection, reusable across imports:

```yaml
apiVersion: forklift.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: VMImportSource
metadata:
  name: vcenter-prod
  namespace: tenant-foo
spec:
  type: vsphere
  url: https://vcenter.example.com/sdk
  credentials:
    username: mtv-migration@vsphere.local
    password: "..."
    caCert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Then an import, which is one-shot:

```yaml
apiVersion: forklift.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: VMImportTask
metadata:
  name: import-web-tier
  namespace: tenant-foo
spec:
  sourceRef:
    name: vcenter-prod
  vms:
  - id: vm-1234          # managed-object reference, from the vSphere client URL or `govc ls -i`
    name: web-01
  storageClass: replicated
```

Deleting the task removes the migration machinery and leaves `web-01` and its disks in place: they are ordinary Cozystack objects from the moment they exist, and carry no owner reference back to the task. Deleting the source deregisters the connection — its Forklift Provider and projected Secret go with it, and nothing already imported is touched.

Created VMs start `Halted`, not running. A freshly imported guest usually needs its network reconfigured, and booting it the instant the transfer finishes can put a second copy of a still-running production machine on the network.

## When the cluster cannot reach the ESXi host

Disk data does not travel through vCenter. The VDDK opens its connection straight to the ESXi host holding the VM, at whatever address vCenter advertises for that host — and that address is often one the cluster cannot use.

Check it before the first import, because the failure comes late. The address vCenter advertises must be routable from the worker nodes and, critically, **must not fall inside the cluster's Service CIDR**: an address in that range is claimed by service routing, the packets never leave the node, and the transfer dies after validation has already passed. Compare the two:

```sh
# what vCenter advertises for the host, as the engine sees it
kubectl -n cozy-forklift exec deploy/forklift-controller -c inventory -- \
  curl -sk "https://localhost:8443/providers/vsphere/<provider-uid>/hosts"

# the cluster's Service CIDR, via the address of the kubernetes service
kubectl get svc -n default kubernetes -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
```

A host that is unreachable, or that collides, gets an entry on the source:

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - id: host-10              # the host's managed-object id, as the VM's inventory record names it
    address: 10.31.0.29      # an address the cluster can actually reach
    credentials:
      username: root
      password: "..."
      insecureSkipVerify: true
```

The credentials are the ESXi host's own account, not the vCenter one: the host authenticates this connection itself rather than honouring the vCenter session, and the engine connection-tests the pair before any transfer starts. That is also why the field takes a full credential rather than a bare address.

Symptom when the override is missing: the task reaches `Transferring`, sits there, and then fails with an NBD error — `nbd_connect_uri: the server has no export named ''` — which names neither the address nor the reason.

## TLS: caCert or insecureSkipVerify, not a thumbprint

Exactly one of these must be set, and the API rejects the object at admission otherwise.

`caCert` is the PEM certificate authority that signed the endpoint's certificate. `insecureSkipVerify: true` turns verification off — convenient in a lab and a poor idea anywhere else, since the credentials above travel over that same connection.

A SHA-1 **thumbprint does not work here**, and this is worth stating plainly because the engine's own error is misleading. Forklift's vSphere provider validation requires `user`, `password`, and either a `cacert` key or `insecureSkipVerify`; given a thumbprint instead it marks the provider `SecretNotValid` with the message "The secret is not valid", which reads like a credentials problem and is not. A thumbprint is what the engine wants for a *direct ESXi host* connection, a path this version does not expose.

## vCenter privileges

Neither `Administrator` nor a plain read-only role is right. Read-only cannot do the job, and Administrator hands the cluster a credential whose blast radius is the entire vCenter — and that credential lands in a Secret in the tenant's own namespace.

Clone the read-only role, add the privileges Forklift documents, and assign it to a service account created for the migration campaign and disabled afterwards. Scope it to the datacenter being migrated, propagated to children — not the whole vCenter.

Eleven privileges cover a cold migration, and several of them are writes, which is why read-only is not enough:

- `Datastore.Browse`, `Datastore.FileManagement`
- `Sessions.ValidateSession`
- `VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOff`, `.PowerOn`, `.GuestControl`
- `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DiskRandomAccess`, `.FileRandomAccess`, `.DiskRandomRead`, `.GetVmFiles`, `.PutVmFiles`

Warm migration adds `VirtualMachine.State.CreateSnapshot` and `.RemoveSnapshot`; encrypted guests need the `Cryptographer.*` set. Older vendor documentation asks for all fifteen `Provisioning` privileges — the remainder only matter for template migration, which this path does not do.

Two things about that role are worth knowing before you build it. vCenter **silently ignores an unknown privilege**, so a typo produces a role that looks correct and is quietly under-privileged; enumerate the valid identifiers with `govc role.ls Admin` rather than trusting a document. And the identifiers themselves have drifted between versions — what one document calls `Cryptographic.Direct access` is `Cryptographer.Access` on vSphere 7.

Note that the VDDK opens NFC connections to the **ESXi hosts** on TCP 443 and 902, not only to vCenter. That matters more than it sounds: vCenter frequently advertises a host on an address the cluster cannot reach, and the transfer then fails with `VixDiskLib_Open ... The server refused connection` while everything about the provider still looks healthy. When that address is unusable, list the host under `spec.hosts` with an address the cluster can reach and its own ESXi credentials — the host authenticates that connection itself rather than honouring the vCenter session.

A related trap on the cluster side: if the cluster's Service CIDR overlaps the ESXi network, the VDDK breaks before anything else does.

*The privilege detail above comes from the operational work on the original VMware import implementation, validated against a real vCenter.*

## Storage

Every disk of a task lands on `spec.storageClass`, or the cluster default when it is omitted. Either way the class must bind `Immediate`.

A `WaitForFirstConsumer` class does not fail an import, it **hangs** it: nothing consumes the claim while CDI populates it, so the transfer waits forever. The controller checks the binding mode before creating anything and fails the task with a message naming the class. On a stock Cozystack install the default class is `local`, which is `WaitForFirstConsumer` — so a task that names no class fails immediately with that explanation. `replicated` qualifies.

The transferred volume is handed to its `VMDisk` without being copied: the `PersistentVolume` is retained and re-bound into the claim the disk expects. That volume stays on `Retain` permanently and this is part of the contract, not an implementation detail — CDI takes a controller owner reference on an adopted claim, so deleting the DataVolume garbage-collects the claim, and only the reclaim policy keeps the data.

**Budget roughly twice each disk's size against the tenant quota while an import runs.** CDI allocates a prime volume of the target size *and* a scratch volume of about 106% of it, so a 230 GiB disk occupies around 474 GiB until the transfer finishes. On a tenant near its quota this shows up as the import stalling on `exceeded quota` rather than as anything resembling a storage error, and it clears on its own once the previous disk releases its transit volumes.

Also expect a second phase that nothing reports. After the download, CDI runs `qemu-img convert` from scratch onto the target volume — around half an hour per 230 GiB — while the DataVolume's own progress sits frozen at 99.92%, because that counter only ever measured the download. The real percentage is only visible in the importer pod's log.

## Timings, for planning

Measured on a real vSphere source during the original implementation work, on a 16 GiB UEFI Linux guest:

| Path | Duration |
|---|---|
| VDDK raw copy (what this version does) | ≈2 min 55 s |
| virt-v2v conversion plus its cross-namespace clone | ≈5 min 46 s |

The factor of two is the second copy, not the conversion. For scale at the other end: a 160 GiB Windows Server OVF expanding to 295 GiB took about an hour and five minutes end to end, with the disk transfer itself running near 80 MiB/s.

## Privilege model

Nothing on the transfer path is privileged. With guest conversion off — the only mode this version offers — no Forklift pod moves the bytes at all: Forklift emits a CDI DataVolume with a VDDK source and CDI's own importer does the work, and that pod satisfies the `restricted` Pod Security Standard. Verified against Forklift v2.11.5 and CDI v1.64.0, and confirmed on a live cluster by importing into a namespace enforcing `restricted` with no admission denial.

Guest conversion is a separate matter: it needs a node-level seccomp profile, because libguestfs starts `passt`, which unconditionally creates its own namespaces. It is deliberately not part of this version.

Tenants get read and write on both kinds through the standard aggregation labels, and no access at all to `forklift.konveyor.io` — the Forklift objects a task builds are internal machinery.

## Failure modes worth recognising

**A task stuck in `Creating` with the transfer finished** usually means the engine reported success without producing anything. A Plan that already has a failed attempt in its history can report `SUCCEEDED` on a retry while creating neither the volume nor the VM; the task surfaces this rather than hanging, and the remedy is a new task (which builds a new Plan) rather than retrying the old one.

**A transfer whose progress sits at 0 for many minutes** is not reported as an error on any of the migration objects. Look at the target namespace's claim events — the usual cause is the VDDK failing to reach an ESXi host, which surfaces there and nowhere else. When it eventually does fail, the message is `Unable to connect to vddk data source: nbd_connect_uri: the server has no export named ''`, which sounds like a missing disk and is almost always an unreachable host address: see [When the cluster cannot reach the ESXi host](#when-the-cluster-cannot-reach-the-esxi-host).

**A VM that reports `SecretNotValid` or an authentication failure** on a vCenter source is usually the username, not the password: vCenter wants the SSO domain (`user@vsphere.local`), and rejects a bare account name with the same message it uses for a wrong password.

**`server-side dry run does not protect you here.`** `kubectl apply --dry-run=server` is not honoured by Cozystack's aggregated API: for `apps.cozystack.io` resources it really creates the object. That applies to the `VMInstance` and `VMDisk` an import produces, so do not use it as a safety net when experimenting.

**Instance types are not interchangeable after the fact.** A `VirtualMachineInstance` is immutable, so changing `instanceType` on an imported VM requires deleting the VMI to have it re-created. Some catalog sizes also request hugepages, which a node without them cannot satisfy — the VM then stays `Pending` with `Insufficient hugepages-2Mi` rather than failing outright.

## Uninstalling

Remove the `ForkliftController` operand before the operator, or CRD deletion deadlocks on the operand's finalizer with nothing left running to clear it:

```sh
kubectl patch forkliftcontroller -n cozy-forklift forklift-controller \
  --type merge -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'
```
