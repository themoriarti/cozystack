# others. A hand-merge from a newer upstream KubeVirt CR may drop one directive
# while keeping the rest; `make update` must self-heal whichever directive is
# missing rather than fail. The trap this pins: a single guard that gates the
# insertion of two directives at once silently skips the second one when the
# first is still present, and the sanity-check tail then aborts the target.
