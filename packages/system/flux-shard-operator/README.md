# flux-shard-operator

Spreads tenant HelmReleases across multiple helm-controller shards so a noisy tenant (e.g. a HelmRelease stuck in remediation) cannot degrade the others. The damage of a saturated helm-controller is per-pod / per-informer, so horizontal sharding with per-shard label-scoped informers is what isolates both worker starvation and cache-lag blast radius.

## What it does

The operator has three parts, all served by one Deployment (leader-elected controllers, webhook on every replica):

1. **Shard runtime.** Reconciles `shardCount` helm-controller Deployments (`helm-controller-shard<i>`, `--watch-label-selector=sharding.fluxcd.io/key=shard<i>`) in the flux namespace, cloned from the flux-aio `flux` Deployment's helm-controller container and sanitised (no host networking, no localhost cross-container wiring, no inherited corporate-proxy env, and a startupProbe guarding a slow start). The helm-controller image and feature-gates are inherited from flux-aio automatically. Deployments beyond `shardCount` are pruned once they drain, and the legacy hand-rolled `flux-tenants` Deployment is retired once no HelmRelease carries `sharding.fluxcd.io/key=tenants`.

2. **Placement controller.** Owns the tenant→shard assignment. The unit of placement is the tenant: all HelmReleases of one tenant (parent `tenant-<id>` plus everything in namespace `tenant-<id>`) carry the same shard label, so a noisy tenant's blast radius is bounded to its shard's co-residents. Tenants are distributed greedy least-loaded, weighted by HelmRelease count (N tenants over N shards land exactly 1 per shard). The assignment is recorded as the `internal.cozystack.io/flux-shard` label on the tenant namespace; HelmRelease labels remain the source of truth on restarts. Moves are paced and deleting tenants are never moved. Watches are metadata-only, so the controller does not decode the helm-controller status-patch firehose.

3. **Mutating webhook (CREATE-only, `failurePolicy: Ignore`).** Stamps the tenant's shard onto every HelmRelease at admission, so each one is born on the correct shard regardless of creation path. On webhook outage or before the first assignment, HelmReleases keep their legacy `tenants` key until the placement controller relabels them — graceful degradation, never blocked creation.

System (non-tenant) HelmReleases are untouched: flux-aio keeps reconciling everything without a shard key (`!sharding.fluxcd.io/key`).

## Autosizing

With `shardCount: auto` (the default) the operator drives the shard count from the tenant HelmRelease count: `K = clamp(ceil(H/100), 1, min(16, T))`, applied with hysteresis anchored on the currently provisioned shards (scale up eagerly once a shard runs >120 HR, scale down lazily only under 60 HR/shard) so K does not flap around sizing boundaries. The ~100 HR/shard target leaves headroom for existing tenants growing their HelmRelease count without an immediate reshard. Set an integer to pin the count explicitly.

## Bootstrap on fresh installs

On a fresh cluster the first tenant helm-controller appears through a runtime chain: cert-manager issues the webhook/serving certificate, the operator starts, clones `helm-controller-shard0` from flux-aio, and the placement controller assigns tenants once shard0 reports Ready (assignments only ever target ready shards). Until then tenant HelmReleases stay on their born `sharding.fluxcd.io/key=tenants` label and are simply not reconciled yet — the same install-order dependency as other cert-manager-gated components (capi-operator, capi-providers), surfaced as the platform HelmReleases not turning Ready. To debug a stalled bootstrap, walk the chain in order: cert-manager webhook up → `flux-shard-operator` Deployment Ready (image pull, cert mount) → `helm-controller-shard0` Ready → HelmReleases relabeled off `tenants`.

## Telemetry

The operator exports `cozy_flux_shard_load`, `cozy_flux_shard_tenants`, `cozy_flux_shard_helmreleases`, `cozy_flux_shard_pending_moves`, `cozy_flux_shard_moves_total` and `cozy_flux_shard_recommended_count` (the raw autosizing recommendation before hysteresis). Metrics are served plain-HTTP on `:8080` and the operator pod carries `prometheus.io/scrape` annotations; gauges are populated by the leader replica.
