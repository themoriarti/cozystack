# Detect DRBD resources stuck in Primary on this node with no consumer.
# Auto-promote can promote a resource to Primary (e.g. during mkfs.ext4
# at provisioning time), but auto-demote sometimes fails to fire on
# close. The resource then stays Primary on a node that has no
# consumer and blocks NodePublishVolume on the actual target node with
# "failed to set source device readwrite". Upstream tracker:
#   https://github.com/piraeusdatastore/piraeus-operator/issues/942
#
# `open == false` on every device of the resource guarantees nobody is
# using it, so `drbdadm secondary` is safe — at worst it's a no-op
# that auto-promote will redo when a real consumer arrives.
