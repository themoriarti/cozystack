                        - Label selector conditions (matchExpressions and matchLabels)
                        - AND has a name that matches one of the names in resourceNames (if specified)

                        The resourceNames field supports Go templates with the following variables available:
                        - {{ .name }}: The name of the managing application (from apps.cozystack.io/application.name)
                        - {{ .kind }}: The lowercased kind of the managing application (from apps.cozystack.io/application.kind)
                        - {{ .namespace }}: The namespace of the resource being processed
