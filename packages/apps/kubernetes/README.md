# Managed Kubernetes Service

## Managed Kubernetes in Cozystack

Whenever you want to deploy a custom containerized application in Cozystack, it's best to deploy it to a managed Kubernetes cluster.

Cozystack deploys and manages Kubernetes-as-a-service as standalone applications within each tenant’s isolated environment.
In Cozystack, such clusters are named tenant Kubernetes clusters, while the base Cozystack cluster is called a management or root cluster.
Tenant clusters are fully separated from the management cluster and are intended for deploying tenant-specific or customer-developed applications.

Within a tenant cluster, users can take advantage of LoadBalancer services and easily provision physical volumes as needed.                               
The control-plane operates within containers, while the worker nodes are deployed as virtual machines, all seamlessly managed by the application.

Kubernetes version in tenant clusters is independent of Kubernetes in the management cluster.
Users can select the supported patch versions from 1.31 to 1.35.

## Why Use a Managed Kubernetes Cluster?

Kubernetes has emerged as the industry standard, providing a unified and accessible API, primarily utilizing YAML for configuration.
This means that teams can easily understand and work with Kubernetes, streamlining infrastructure management.

Kubernetes leverages robust software design patterns, enabling continuous recovery in any scenario through the reconciliation method.
Additionally, it ensures seamless scaling across a multitude of servers,
addressing the challenges posed by complex and outdated APIs found in traditional virtualization platforms.
This managed service eliminates the need for developing custom solutions or modifying source code, saving valuable time and effort.

The Managed Kubernetes Service in Cozystack offers a streamlined solution for efficiently managing server workloads.

## Starting Work

Once the tenant Kubernetes cluster is ready, you can get a kubeconfig file to work with it.
It can be done via UI or a `kubectl` request:

-   Open the Cozystack dashboard, switch to your tenant, find and open the application page. Copy one of the config files from the **Secrets** section.
-   Run the following command (using the management cluster kubeconfig):

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret -n tenant-<name> kubernetes-<clusterName>-admin-kubeconfig -o go-template='{{ printf "%s\n" (index .data "admin.conf" | base64decode) }}' > admin.conf
    ```

There are several kubeconfig options available:

-   `admin.conf` — The standard kubeconfig for accessing your new cluster.
    You can create additional Kubernetes users using this configuration.
-   `admin.svc` — Same token as `admin.conf`, but with the API server address set to the internal service name.
    Use it for applications running inside the cluster that need API access.
-   `super-admin.conf` — Similar to `admin.conf`, but with extended administrative permissions.
    Intended for troubleshooting and cluster maintenance tasks.
-   `super-admin.svc` — Same as `super-admin.conf`, but pointing to the internal API server address.

## Implementation Details

A tenant Kubernetes cluster in Cozystack is essentially Kubernetes-in-Kubernetes.
Deploying it involves the following components:

-   **Kamaji Control Plane**: [Kamaji](https://kamaji.clastix.io/) is an open-source project that facilitates the deployment
    of Kubernetes control planes as pods within a root cluster.
    Each control plane pod includes essential components like `kube-apiserver`, `controller-manager`, and `scheduler`,
    allowing for efficient multi-tenancy and resource utilization.

-   **Etcd Cluster**: A dedicated etcd cluster is deployed using the cozystack [etcd-operator](https://github.com/cozystack/etcd-operator) (`etcd-operator.cozystack.io/v1alpha2`).
    It provides reliable and scalable key-value storage for the Kubernetes control plane.

-   **Worker Nodes**: Virtual Machines are provisioned to serve as worker nodes using KubeVirt.
    These nodes are configured to join the tenant Kubernetes cluster, enabling the deployment and management of workloads.
    Worker node disks automatically detect and match the underlying volume's block size
    (`blockSize.matchVolume`) to ensure compatibility with storage backends that use
    non-512-byte sectors, such as LINSTOR DRBD with 4Kn drives.

-   **Cluster API**: Cozystack is using the [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to provision the components of a cluster.

This architecture ensures isolated, scalable, and efficient tenant Kubernetes environments.

## Breaking Changes

- **`ephemeralStorage` renamed to `diskSize`** (v1.4): The `nodeGroups[name].ephemeralStorage` field has been renamed to `nodeGroups[name].diskSize`. Existing clusters are migrated transparently by platform migration 41 during the pre-upgrade hook — no manual action is required. Newly written values should use `diskSize`. Existing VMs are rolling-updated via CAPI when the new values are applied. With the Talos worker rollover in this release the field now sizes the **single system disk** (Talos OS image streamed from `factory.talos.dev`, kubelet state, containerd image cache, local-path PVCs) — the pre-Talos `disk-kubelet` PVC layout was removed. State on that single disk persists across same-VM reboots (virt-launcher restart, guest reboot, node failure); VM replacement by CAPI (e.g. nodeGroup field change, MachineHealthCheck remediation) provisions a fresh disk.

- **Air-gapped tenant workers (Phase 1 Talos rollover)**: tenant worker bootstrap moves from Ubuntu containerDisk + kubeadm to a Talos OS disk image fetched over HTTP by CDI and a `.../installer/...` installer reference. Both sources are now overridable — set `talos.imageFactoryURL` (default `https://factory.talos.dev`) to a self-hosted Image Factory, a caching mirror, or an internal HTTP file server, and `talos.installerRepository` (default `factory.talos.dev/installer`) to a mirrored registry. The Helm-rendered `*-patch-containerd` Secret that previously plumbed the platform-wide `registries.mirrors` config to tenant workers (via the kubeadm template's containerd certs.d mount) has no consumer in the Talos machineconfig and was removed in this release; **in-guest container-image pulls** (pods pulling from registries inside the tenant cluster) still honour no per-tenant `registries.mirrors` override until Phase 2 restores it via `machine.registries.mirrors` knobs. So a strict-egress tenant can now mirror the Talos OS image and installer, but rate-limited in-guest registry pulls remain a Phase 2 follow-up — file an issue if you depend on this and it is not yet landed.

- **Worker MachineHealthCheck remediation is now enabled by default** (Phase 1 Talos rollover): the worker MHC `maxUnhealthy` moved from a hard-coded `0` (remediation effectively **off**) to a configurable `nodeHealthCheck.maxUnhealthy` defaulting to `"50%"`. CAPI now auto-remediates (deletes and replaces) unhealthy worker Machines while at least 50% of a group stays healthy. `"50%"` deliberately leaves headroom for transient unhealthy nodes during the kubeadm→Talos rollover and slow first boots from `factory.talos.dev`; set `nodeHealthCheck.maxUnhealthy: "0%"` to keep the previous remediation-off behaviour until your fleet is stable on Talos workers.

- **GitOps-managed tenant `Kubernetes` CRs must bump `spec.version` in Git** (Phase 1 Talos rollover): platform migration 46 patches live `kuberneteses.apps.cozystack.io` objects from `v1.30` to `v1.31` (v1.30 left the Talos↔Kubernetes support matrix). When the tenant `Kubernetes` CR is reconciled from Git (Flux/Argo), the next source reconcile re-applies `version: v1.30` over migration 46's patch, which then trips the chart's `_versions.tpl` guard and the HelmRelease fails. Update `spec.version` to `v1.31` (or newer) in your Git source before/with the platform upgrade. Tenants managed via the API or dashboard need no action — migration 46 handles them.

- **Remote-accessible LINSTOR StorageClasses are auto-propagated to tenants** (v1.5): infra-cluster LINSTOR StorageClasses whose `linstor.csi.linbit.com/allowRemoteVolumeAccess` is not `"false"` are created inside each tenant under the same name (provisioned by `csi.kubevirt.io`). **Upgrade caveat:** delete any *manually created* tenant StorageClass whose name collides with a propagated infra class (e.g. a hand-made `replicated`) before upgrading, or the propagated class cannot be created and the tenant CSI release will not converge. Infra classes that must stay node-local need `allowRemoteVolumeAccess: "false"` set explicitly — an absent annotation is treated as remote-accessible. Propagation is evaluated at HelmRelease render time, so classes added or removed on the infra cluster after a tenant exists propagate only on that tenant's next reconcile.

- **Worker pools split into `KubernetesNodes` (Phase 2)**: `spec.nodeGroups`, `spec.nodeHealthCheck` and `spec.maxNodeProvisionTime` are removed from the `Kubernetes` CR — worker pools are now separate `KubernetesNodes` resources (one HelmRelease per pool; see the `kubernetes-nodes` chart), on which `spec.cluster` and `spec.storageClass` are immutable (`self == oldSelf`). Existing pools are adopted automatically on upgrade by platform migration 56 with no worker-VM churn. Consequences: (1) the `Kubernetes` CR's `WorkloadsReady` condition is now **control-plane-only** — worker health is reported on each `KubernetesNodes` resource, so a dashboard or `kubectl wait` watching the parent no longer reflects worker readiness; (2) enabling `addons.ingressNginx` now requires a pool carrying `roles: [ingress-nginx]` (the implicit default `md0` is gone — without such a pool the controller DaemonSet schedules nothing); (3) do **not** edit `Kubernetes` CRs during a platform upgrade — a mid-window parent render can transiently fail Helm ownership validation while migration 56 re-annotates worker objects, and self-heals once the new chart artifact lands; (4) when deleting a cluster, delete its `KubernetesNodes` pools **before** the parent `Kubernetes` resource, so each pool's pre-delete unpin hook can run while the tenant apiserver and the CAPI CRDs still exist — deleting the parent first can leave the pool release reconciling CAPI objects against a cluster that is being torn down (in the pre-split monolith the pools were part of the parent release and died with it; they are now separate resources with their own lifecycle); (5) the removed fields (`nodeGroups`, `nodeHealthCheck`, `maxNodeProvisionTime`) are still **accepted and stored** on an already-upgraded `Kubernetes` CR — the adoption migration deliberately leaves them in place rather than rewriting parent values mid-upgrade — but they have **no effect**: editing them (for example scaling via `spec.nodeGroups.<pool>.minReplicas`) does nothing, and the API returns an admission warning pointing you at the `KubernetesNodes` resources. A cluster name is also capped at 32 characters so every pool's `KubernetesNodes` release name fits the 53-character Helm limit. ComputePlane clusters (the `computeplane` module) are affected the same way: their worker pools are rendered as separate per-pool `KubernetesNodes` releases too (materialised directly by the module rather than adopted), so the same pool-name length limit applies to their `nodeGroups` keys.

> The top-level `storageClass` field is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it. The per-pool worker `storageClass` now lives on the `KubernetesNodes` resource (see the `kubernetes-nodes` chart).

| `controlPlane.apiServer.extraArgs`                  | Extra command-line flags appended to the tenant kube-apiserver, passed through to KamajiControlPlane `spec.apiServer.extraArgs`. For OIDC use `spec.oidc.mode` — this passthrough is the escape hatch for other apiserver flags (`--requestheader-uid-headers=X-Remote-Uid`, feature gates, etc). Do NOT add legacy `--oidc-*` flags here when `spec.oidc.mode` is not `None`; the chart injects `--authentication-config` and the apiserver refuses to boot with both. Empty by default (no change to current behavior).                                                                                                                          | `[]string` | `[]`        |
| `controlPlane.apiServer.extraVolumes`               | Extra volumes added to the control-plane Deployment, passed through to KamajiControlPlane `spec.deployment.extraVolumes`. Use to mount a ConfigMap or Secret holding an AuthenticationConfiguration file referenced by `extraArgs`. Each item is a core/v1 Volume, but because the control-plane pod runs on the management cluster only `configMap` and `secret` sources are allowed (host-reaching sources like `hostPath`/`csi` and token-projection via `projected` are rejected); each volume must have a unique, non-empty name and exactly one source. The names `talos-ca` and `talos-tls-cert` are reserved by the chart. Empty by default. | `[]object` | `[]`        |
| `controlPlane.apiServer.extraVolumeMounts`          | Extra volume mounts added to the tenant kube-apiserver container, passed through to KamajiControlPlane `spec.apiServer.extraVolumeMounts`. Each `name` must reference a volume declared in `extraVolumes`; the chart-managed talos secret volumes cannot be mounted. Each item is a core/v1 VolumeMount.

| `talos.imageFactoryURL`     | Base URL of the Talos Image Factory that serves the worker OS disk image (the `openstack-amd64.raw.xz` raw artifact streamed in by CDI over HTTP). Defaults to the public factory. Point at a self-hosted Image Factory, a caching mirror, or an internal HTTP file server for air-gapped, rate-limited, or flaky-egress environments. No trailing slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `string` | `https://factory.talos.dev`                                        |
| `talos.installerRepository` | OCI repository prefix for the Talos installer image used by the in-guest `talos-reconcile` upgrade Job. Resolved as `<installerRepository>/<schematicID>:<version>`. Defaults to the public factory's installer path. Override for air-gapped or mirrored registries. No trailing slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `string` | `factory.talos.dev/installer`                                      |
| `talos.registryMirrors`     | Talos `machine.registries.mirrors` passthrough for worker nodes: a map of upstream registry host to `{ endpoints: [ ... ] }`. Empty by default, so workers pull container images (the Talos `kubelet` image included) directly from the upstream registry. Point a host such as `ghcr.io` at an in-cluster pull-through mirror for air-gapped, rate-limited, or flaky-egress environments so a worker's boot does not depend on live public egress. Talos still falls back to the upstream registry unless a host also sets `skipFallback: true`, so a mirror alone does not enforce air-gap. | `object` | `{}`                                                               |

## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
When left empty, the preset defined in `resourcesPreset` is applied.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m

### U Series: Universal

The U Series is quite neutral and provides resources for
general purpose applications.

*U* is the abbreviation for "Universal", hinting at the universal
attitude towards workloads.

VMs of instance types will share physical CPU cores on a
time-slice basis with other VMs.

#### U Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4, for less
  noise per node.

### O Series: Overcommitted

The O Series is based on the U Series, with the only difference
being that memory is overcommitted.

*O* is the abbreviation for "Overcommitted".

#### O Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *Overcommitted Memory* - Memory is over-committed in order to achieve
  a higher workload density.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4, for less
  noise per node.

### CX Series: Compute Exclusive

The CX Series provides exclusive compute resources for compute
intensive applications.

*CX* is the abbreviation of "Compute Exclusive".

The exclusive resources are given to the compute threads of the
VM. In order to ensure this, some additional cores (depending
on the number of disks and NICs) will be requested to offload
the IO threading from cores dedicated to the workload.
In addition, in this series, the NUMA topology of the used
cores is provided to the VM.

#### CX Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Dedicated CPU* - Physical cores are exclusively assigned to every
  vCPU in order to provide fixed and high compute guarantees to the
  workload.
- *Isolated emulator threads* - Hypervisor emulator threads are isolated
  from the vCPUs in order to reduce emaulation related impact on the
  workload.
- *vNUMA* - Physical NUMA topology is reflected in the guest in order to
  optimize guest sided cache utilization.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:2)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:2.

### M Series: Memory

The M Series provides resources for memory intensive
applications.

*M* is the abbreviation of "Memory".

#### M Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:8)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:8, for much
  less noise per node.

### RT Series: RealTime

The RT Series provides resources for realtime applications, like Oslat.

*RT* is the abbreviation for "realtime".

This series of instance types requires nodes capable of running
realtime applications.

#### RT Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Dedicated CPU* - Physical cores are exclusively assigned to every
  vCPU in order to provide fixed and high compute guarantees to the
  workload.
- *Isolated emulator threads* - Hypervisor emulator threads are isolated
  from the vCPUs in order to reduce emaulation related impact on the
  workload.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4 starting from
  the medium size.
