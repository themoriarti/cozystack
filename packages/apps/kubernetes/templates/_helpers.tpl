wait-for-kubeconfig init container shared by the control-plane-side
Deployments (cluster-autoscaler, kccm, kcsi-controller) that mount the

Kamaji is still bootstrapping; this container polls the mounted path and
exits only when super-admin.svc appears, which happens after kubelet's
optional-Secret refresh cycle.

The 10m deadline stays strictly below the 20m HelmRelease
Install.Timeout set by cozystack-api for the Kubernetes kind (via the
release.cozystack.io/helm-install-timeout annotation on the cozyrds
entry) so the CrashLoopBackOff surfaces before flux remediation fires and uninstalls
the Cluster CR.

The default image lives in images/busybox.tag and points directly at
docker.io by digest (not mirrored to ghcr.io like the other .tag files
here): the payload is a one-shot sh loop and the digest pin makes the
pull immutable. Operators in air-gapped or rate-limited environments
can override it via .Values.images.waitForKubeconfig (any registry
reference kubelet can pull). When the value is empty the chart falls
back to the bundled digest pin, preserving the prior default.

Call site owns the surrounding volumes block; the kubeconfig volume
must exist on the pod and mount at /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig.

Effective worker node groups.

The default "md0" group is applied here, in the template, only when the user
supplies no nodeGroups at all. Keeping the default out of values.yaml makes
user-supplied nodeGroups authoritative: a Helm values merge would otherwise
re-add a baked-in default md0 on top of the user's groups, and because
Kubernetes strips null values the default could never be removed. With the
default applied only when the map is empty, users can freely choose their own
node groups (and omit md0).

The default carries `minReplicas: 0`, which now propagates through to
`MachineDeployment.spec.replicas: 0` (see the templates/cluster.yaml comment
next to that field). Consequence: an empty-`nodeGroups` install provisions
NO workers until either the cluster-autoscaler responds to an unschedulable
Pod or an operator explicitly scales the group up. If the operator plans to
enable the ingress-nginx addon, either supply an explicit nodeGroup with
`roles: [ingress-nginx]` and `minReplicas >= 1`, or accept that the
autoscaler will bring the default md0 up in response to the ingress-nginx
controller Pods becoming Pending on install.

CEL claimValidationRule body — rejects tokens whose `groups` claim does
NOT carry at least one of the tenant's four Keycloak groups. The tenant
chart (packages/apps/tenant) provisions these groups per-tenant in the
`cozy` realm; the namespace name is the tenant identifier for both root
and nested tenants (see tenant.name in the tenant chart helpers), so
`.Release.Namespace` is the correct prefix.

The `has(claims.groups) &&` guard is required — CEL evaluation of
`claims.groups.exists(...)` on a token missing the claim raises a
runtime error that surfaces as HTTP 500 from the authenticator rather
than the intended 401. `has()` short-circuits that path into a plain
unauthorized outcome with the `message` string in the audit log.

Why enforce membership at the apiserver even though RBAC default-denies
unmapped identities: `system:authenticated` still leaks the OpenAPI +
discovery surface (kubectl auth can-i --list, kubectl api-resources,
`/apis/*` schemata) to every user in the shared `cozy` realm — a
tenant-alice user could enumerate tenant-bob's cluster's CRDs and
built-in resource shape. Adding a hard cross-tenant gate here matches
the design's stated authorization boundary (per-tenant kube-apiserver
= per-tenant identity domain) rather than relying on downstream
RBAC-shaped conservatism.

Validates and returns a duration destined for a consumer that does not reject

timeouts at all, so a zero or negative one applies and remediates a Machine the

stops there, which lets "30" and "-5m" reach the template. The accepted shape
is narrower than Go's duration grammar on purpose, because that grammar also
admits a value large enough to overflow the parser -- the silent fallback again
-- and a fraction small enough to round to zero. The first segment must be
positive; later segments may be zero, so the canonical rendering of a duration
