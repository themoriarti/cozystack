kubernetes-nodes.assertTalosSupportsKubernetes fails the render when a Talos
release is paired with a Kubernetes minor outside that Talos minor's support
window. Each Talos minor supports a bounded window of Kubernetes minors; running
a kubelet outside it produces a silently broken Talos+kubelet combination that no
HelmRelease condition can detect, so the render is where it has to be caught.
Source: https://docs.siderolabs.com/talos/v1.13/getting-started/support-matrix

A named template rather than an inline block because the pool resolves TWO Talos
versions and both reach a worker. `talos.version` is the pool default, and
`image.builtin.version` / `image.factory.version` override it for the boot disk
AND for the in-guest installer the reconcile Job writes. Checking only the first
leaves an asymmetry a reader would not expect: a known-bad pairing set through
`talos.version` is rejected, while the same pairing reached through an
`image.*.version` override renders clean. The matrix literal lives here, once, so
the two call sites cannot drift apart.

A Talos minor the matrix does not list passes. That is deliberate and unchanged:
the matrix is a hand-maintained table, and failing closed on it would block every
operator who moves to a newer Talos before this file is updated. What the guard
promises is that a pairing it KNOWS to be bad is refused, not that every pairing
is known.

Arguments: talosVersion, kubernetesVersion, remedy (what the operator should
change, appended to the message).

kubernetes-nodes.resolveOsImage resolves this pool's `osImage` selection down to
the three strings that reach a rendered manifest -- a schematic, a Talos release
and an Image Factory URL -- plus whether the boot disk is a clone of a golden or
an HTTP import.

Two templates need that answer: nodegroup.yaml builds the worker disk source from
it, and talos-reconcile-job.yaml builds the in-guest installer reference from it.
They must agree, because a disk booted from one Talos flavor and an installer
pinned to another is exactly the silently-broken pairing this chart's support
matrix was factored out to prevent, and it would surface only as a node that
upgrades itself onto the wrong OS. So the resolution lives here once rather than
being mirrored by hand in both files.

The result comes back through the caller's `out` dict rather than as text,
because four values have to return and a delimited string would need parsing at
both call sites.

The three format checks live here too, for the same reason. The values are
tenant-controlled strings that land unquoted in a KubevirtMachineTemplate and in
a DataVolume name, and the schema types all three as a bare string and cannot
narrow them: the pinned cozyvalues-gen derives `pattern` from the value TYPE
(quantity) and has no annotation for a custom one. So the check is at render
time, which is where this chart already validates the kubelet reservation fields
for the same class of hazard. The resolved values are checked, not just the
overridden ones -- an override and the pool default reach the same interpolation.
The patterns accept every form the chart ships and every form a Talos Image
Factory produces (a 64-character hex schematic, a vN.N.N release, an http(s) URL)
and reject the bytes that would break out of a YAML scalar.

Arguments: osImage (the pool's .Values.osImage), talos (.Values.talos), out (the

Name of the cluster's default StorageClass, or the empty string when there is

An empty storageClass is a documented, schema-valid setting on both a worker pool

resolving it the golden-versus-pool StorageClass comparison simply skips whenever
either side is empty, which is the one corner where skipping is worst: CDI then
falls back to a host-assisted copy over the pod network, silently, and that copy
is the transfer the clone path exists to remove.

Both the current annotation and its beta predecessor count, because clusters
provisioned years apart carry different ones and Kubernetes still honours both.

More than one class may carry the annotation at once. Kubernetes permits that --
it is the normal state midway through swapping a cluster's default -- and
resolves it by taking the most recently created, so this does the same. Emitting
every match instead concatenates their names into a class that does not exist,
and the comparison below then rejects a pool whose class matches the default
that is actually in force. Timestamps are RFC3339 in UTC, so comparing them as
