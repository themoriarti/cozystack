## Managed MariaDB Service

The Managed MariaDB Service offers a powerful and widely used relational database solution.
This service allows you to create and manage a replicated MariaDB cluster seamlessly.

## Deployment Details

This managed service is controlled by mariadb-operator, ensuring efficient management and seamless operation.

- GitHub: https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.

## HowTos

### How to switch master/slave replica

```bash
kubectl edit mariadb <instance>
```
update:

```bash
spec:
  replication:
    primary:
      podIndex: 1
```

check status:

```bash
NAME        READY   STATUS    PRIMARY POD   AGE
<instance>  True    Running   app-db1-1     41d
```

### How to back up and restore a MariaDB application

The recommended path is the Cozystack `BackupClass` / `Plan` /
`RestoreJob` flow with the operator-native `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/MariaDB`
strategy. See [examples/backups/mariadb](../../../examples/backups/mariadb/)
for a numbered, end-to-end walkthrough (bucket, source, strategy,
BackupClass, Plan, ad-hoc BackupJob, and both in-place + to-copy
RestoreJob fixtures).

The chart's `backup.*` block (mariadb-dump + restic CronJob) is
**deprecated** and remains supported for backward compatibility only.
Existing tenants can keep using it unchanged; new deployments should
use the operator-native flow above.

#### How to restore from a deprecated restic-based backup

find snapshot:
```bash
restic -r s3:s3.example.org/mariadb-backups/database_name snapshots
```


restore:
```bash
restic -r s3:s3.example.org/mariadb-backups/database_name restore latest --target /tmp/
```

### How to connect over TLS

> Kubernetes objects for an instance are named after the Helm release, which prefixes the instance name: an instance `mydb` produces the Service and Secrets `mariadb-mydb-*`. The names below use `mariadb-<name>` for that reason, while `<instance>` elsewhere in this document is the name of the `MariaDB` resource itself.

TLS is always served. `tls.issuer` selects who issues the certificate:

| `tls.issuer` | issued by | covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operator` (default) | mariadb-operator's own CA | `mariadb-<name>`, `-primary`, `-secondary`, the headless service, `localhost` |
| `cert-manager` | a CA issued for this instance | the same, plus the external hostname when `external` is `true` |

The operator has no way to learn the external hostname, so verifying a connection from outside the cluster requires `tls.issuer: cert-manager`.

The default is `operator`, and it is not derived from `external`: switching issuer re-issues the server certificate under a new authority, which breaks any client that pinned the previous `ca.crt` without making anything safer — those instances already serve TLS.

> The field is named for the issuer, not for on/off, because TLS is on either way. Some other charts here spell a similar-looking `tls.enabled` that *does* switch TLS on and off; this one deliberately does not, and the enum keeps it from reading as a switch. Epic [#2811](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/issues/2811) tracks converging the TLS surface across charts.

Enforcement is separate. `tls.required: true` sets `require_secure_transport=ON` and refuses plaintext, under either issuer. It defaults to `false` because turning it on disconnects every client not yet using TLS — a decision to make once clients have the CA, not something an upgrade does.

> `tls.required` will default to `true` in a later release, as an announced change.

Connect with the MariaDB client by supplying the CA and asking for full verification:

```bash
mysql -h mariadb-<name> -u <user> -p --ssl-ca=/path/to/ca.crt --ssl-verify-server-cert
```

`-p` without a value prompts for the password, which keeps it out of shell history and out of the process arguments other users can read.

`--ssl-ca` supplies the trust anchor; `--ssl-verify-server-cert` is what checks the server name against the certificate. Whether that second flag defaults to on depends on the version of the *client* you connect with, not the server version selected by `version`: it is off through 10.11 and on from 11.4. Do not read that as "an 11.4 client already verifies". Without `--ssl-ca` it has no trust anchor to verify against, and falls back to an anti-tampering check derived from the password hash, which establishes neither the chain nor the hostname — and cannot be derived at all for a passwordless user. `--ssl-ca` is the load-bearing flag here; pass both and the connection is verified on either client. Note these are MariaDB client options — the MySQL 8 client spells the same intent as `--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`, which the MariaDB client rejects outright.

The trust anchor is published to tenants as `mariadb-<name>.tenant-ca`, an object holding `ca.crt` and nothing else, delivered through the `core.cozystack.io/tenantsecrets` API that the base tenant roles already grant. It is lifted from the operator's own key-free `mariadb-<name>-ca-bundle`, which is reconciled whenever TLS is enabled and follows CA rollovers, but that Secret is not itself granted to tenants: a direct grant on the name would convey whatever happens to occupy it, where the projection conveys only what the platform has vouched for.

```bash
kubectl get tenantsecret mariadb-<name>.tenant-ca -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
```

> **Verifying an external connection requires `tls.issuer: cert-manager`.** The operator's certificate does not carry the external hostname, so a client connecting from outside with `--ssl-verify-server-cert` fails hostname verification against an unmanaged instance no matter which CA it trusts. A cert-manager-issued certificate is what puts `mariadb-<name>.<host>` in the certificate.
>
> Such clients also need a DNS record pointing at the LoadBalancer address: the hostname is a SAN, the address is not, so connecting to the IP directly fails verification either way.

#### Migrating an existing instance

An existing instance keeps the operator's CA and its current enforcement whether or not you upgrade; setting `tls.issuer: cert-manager` is what moves it to a CA issued for it, and that is the step to plan around.

The deprecated `backup.*` CronJob also changes: its client now verifies the server it connects to, against `mariadb-<name>-ca-bundle`, where before it connected without checking. That bundle is present on every instance and carries whichever CA is in use — the operator's, and the chart's as well under `issuer: cert-manager` — and the certificate covers the hostname the job dials, so the verification itself needs no action. Note that this job is separately unable to start — it reads the root password from a Secret name the chart does not render — so on current releases the change is to a job that does not run. Use the `BackupClass` / `Plan` flow instead.

Switching issuer does not enforce anything by itself — enforcement is a separate opt-in — but it does change who issues the server certificate. A client that re-reads `mariadb-<name>.tenant-ca` at connect time follows the change automatically, because the operator keeps both the old and the new CA in `mariadb-<name>-ca-bundle`, which the projection stays in sync with. A client that copied `ca.crt` out and pinned it will fail chain validation once the new certificate is served, and has to re-read the anchor.

> On a fresh instance created with `tls.issuer: cert-manager`, the pods do not start until cert-manager has issued the certificates: the operator needs the server certificate before it creates the StatefulSet. This resolves on its own within a reconcile or two — the chart labels the Secrets so the operator is woken as soon as they appear — but the instance looks stalled in the meantime.

The order to change it in:

1. Switch the issuer and leave enforcement off (the default):

   ```yaml
   tls:
     issuer: cert-manager
   ```

   This step rolls the StatefulSet. The CR gains `serverCertSecretRef` and `serverCASecretRef`, which changes the name of the Secret projected into the pods, and a pod-template change restarts them. On a multi-replica instance that is a rolling restart; on a single-replica one it is downtime for as long as one pod takes to come back. Wait for `kubectl rollout status statefulset/mariadb-<name>` before going on.

2. Distribute `mariadb-<name>.tenant-ca` and move clients onto verified TLS one at a time.
3. Once no plaintext clients remain, require it:

   ```yaml
   tls:
     issuer: cert-manager
     required: true
   ```

Step 3 is the only one that refuses a client by policy, and it happens when you choose it rather than when a platform upgrade rolls through. Step 1 interrupts connections as well, but by restarting the server rather than by rejecting anyone: a client that reconnects is served.

Going back is the same change in reverse: setting `tls.issuer: operator` hands issuance back, and clients have to pick up the operator's CA from the bundle again.

One thing does not clean itself up. The Certificates are removed, but cert-manager is configured not to own the Secrets it issued, so `mariadb-<name>.ca-tls` (the CA private key) and `mariadb-<name>.tls` (the server private key) stay in the namespace. No tenant grant exposes them, but they are private keys, so remove them.

Wait for the rollout first. `mariadb-<name>.tls` is mounted into the running pods for as long as the instance still serves the chart-issued certificate, so deleting it before the operator has reissued and rolled the StatefulSet leaves the next pod unable to start:

```bash
kubectl rollout status statefulset/mariadb-<name>
kubectl delete secret mariadb-<name>.ca-tls mariadb-<name>.tls --ignore-not-found
```

Uninstalling the instance does this for you; only the turn-it-off-and-keep-running case needs the manual step.

### Known issues

- **Replication can't be finished with various errors**
- **Replication can't be finished in case if `binlog` purged**

  Until `mariadbbackup` is not used to bootstrap a node by mariadb-operator (this feature is not implemented yet), follow these manual steps to fix it:
  https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/issues/141#issuecomment-1804760231

- **Corrupted indices**
  Sometimes some indices can be corrupted on master replica, you can recover them from slave:

  ```bash
  mysqldump -h <slave> -P 3306 -u<user> -p<password> --column-statistics=0 <database> <table> ~/tmp/fix-table.sql
  mysql -h <master> -P 3306 -u<user> -p<password> <database> < ~/tmp/fix-table.sql
  ```

  When TLS is enforced (`tls.required`) the server refuses plaintext connections, so add `--ssl-ca=/path/to/ca.crt --ssl-verify-server-cert` to both commands.

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type     | Value      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `tls`          | TLS configuration. Selects who issues the certificates and whether plaintext is refused; TLS itself is always served.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `object` | `{}`       |
| `tls.issuer`   | Who issues the server certificate: `operator` uses the CA mariadb-operator manages itself, `cert-manager` gives the instance its own CA and is what covers the external hostname. Named for the issuer because TLS is served under both, unlike the similarly-spelled `tls.enabled` in some other charts, which does switch TLS on and off. | `string` | `operator` |
| `tls.required` | Refuse plaintext connections (sets MariaDB require_secure_transport=ON). Applies under either issuer. Opt-in: turn it on once every client connects over TLS, since it disconnects those that do not.                                                                                                                                       | `*bool`  | `null`     |

| `users`                          | Users configuration map. Passwords (including the `root` account) are always auto-generated and stored in the `<release>-credentials` Secret; they cannot be set from values — read a user's password from that Secret. A `password` left over in values from before the field was removed is ignored by the render and draws an admission warning, but it is not inert on an upgraded release: the chart preserves whatever password is already in the Secret, which on the first upgrade is the value that was set before removal, so that value stays the live credential until it is rotated (dedicated rotation is tracked in cozystack/community#72). The live password lives only in the Secret. | `map[string]object` | `{}`  |
| `users[name].maxUserConnections` | Maximum number of connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `int`               | `0`   |

## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
Every resource it leaves unset is taken from the preset defined in `resourcesPreset`.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m
  memory: 4Gi
```

`resourcesPreset` sets named CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
This setting is ignored if the corresponding `resources` value is set.

Presets follow a cloud-style `<series>.<size>` naming convention. Five series cover the full CPU-to-memory ratio range (`t1` 1:0.5, `c1` 1:1, `s1` 1:2, `u1` 1:4, `m1` 1:8) and each series ships eight sizes (`nano` through `4xlarge`). The legacy flat names (`nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`) remain accepted as deprecated aliases and keep their original sizes, which do not follow one series: `nano` through `small` equal the `t1` sizes of the same name, while `medium` equals `c1.small` rather than `c1.medium`.

See [`docs/operations/resource-presets.md`](../../../docs/operations/resource-presets.md) for the full size matrix and the legacy-to-instance-type mapping.

### users

```yaml
users:
  user1:
    maxUserConnections: 1000
  user2:
    maxUserConnections: 1000
```

Passwords cannot be set here — they (and the `root` account) are auto-generated and stored in the `<release>-credentials` Secret. Read a user's password with `kubectl get secret <release>-credentials -o json | jq -r '.data["user1"]' | base64 -d` (a username may contain a `.`, which `jsonpath` would treat as a path step and return nothing).


### databases

```yaml
databases:
  myapp1:
    roles:
      admin:
      - user1
      readonly:
      - user2
```
