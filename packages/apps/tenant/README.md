# Tenant

A tenant is the main unit of security on the platform. The closest analogy would be Linux kernel namespaces.

Tenants can be created recursively and are subject to the following rules:

### Tenant naming

Tenant names must be alphanumeric:

-   Lowercase letters (`a-z`) and digits (`0-9`) only
-   Must start with a lowercase letter
-   Dashes (`-`) are **not allowed**, unlike with other services
-   Maximum length depends on the cluster configuration (Helm release prefix and root domain)

This restriction exists to keep consistent naming in tenants, nested tenants, and services deployed in them.
A tenant cannot be named `foo-bar` because parsing internal resource names like `tenant-foo-bar` would be ambiguous.

For example:

-   The root tenant is named `root`, but internally it's referenced as `tenant-root`.
-   A nested tenant could be named `foo`, which would result in `tenant-foo` in service names and URLs.

### Unique domains

Each tenant has its own domain.
By default, (unless otherwise specified), it inherits the domain of its parent with a prefix of its name.
For example, if the parent had the domain `example.org`, then `tenant-foo` would get the domain `foo.example.org` by default.

Kubernetes clusters created in this tenant namespace would get domains like: `kubernetes-cluster.foo.example.org`

Example:
```text       
tenant-root (example.org)
└── tenant-foo (foo.example.org)
    └── kubernetes-cluster1 (kubernetes-cluster1.foo.example.org)
```

### Nesting tenants and reusing parent services

Tenants can be nested.
A tenant administrator can create nested tenants using the "Tenant" application from the catalogue.

Higher-level tenants can view and manage the applications of all their children tenants.
If a tenant does not run their own cluster services, it can access ones of its parent.

For example, you create:
-   Tenant `tenant-u1` with a set of services like `etcd`, `ingress`, `monitoring`.
-   Tenant `tenant-u2` nested in `tenant-u1`.

Let's see what will happen when you run Kubernetes and Postgres under `tenant-u2` namespace.

Since `tenant-u2` does not have its own cluster services like `etcd`, `ingress`, and `monitoring`,
the applications running in `tenant-u2` will use the cluster services of the parent tenant.

This in turn means:

-    The Kubernetes cluster data will be stored in `etcd` for `tenant-u1`.
-    Access to the cluster will be through the common `ingress` of `tenant-u1`.
-    Essentially, all metrics will be collected in the `monitoring` from `tenant-u1`, and only that tenant will have access to them.

Example:
```
tenant-u1
├── etcd
├── ingress
├── monitoring
└── tenant-u2
    ├── kubernetes-cluster1
    └── postgres-db1
```

| `gateway`         | Deploy own Gateway API Gateway (backed by Cilium Gateway API controller). When unset (the default), the chart auto-enables the Gateway for tenants whose apex is derived from the parent (i.e. `host` is empty), and leaves it off for tenants with a custom non-derived apex. Set to `true` or `false` explicitly to override that auto-behaviour. Note: leave the key absent (do not write `gateway: null`) — the chart distinguishes "unset" via missing-key, not via null value, to satisfy the JSON schema generated from this comment. | `bool`                | `false` |
| `seaweedfs`       | Deploy own SeaweedFS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `bool`                | `false` |
| `computeplane`    | Deploy own ComputePlane — a single-tenant, Cozystack-managed cluster for untrusted-code applications. The tenant receives no admin kubeconfig for it. Automatic routing of catalog applications onto it (placement: ComputePlane) is a planned follow-up and is not available yet; until it lands, external catalogs target the cluster via its computeplane-cluster-admin-kubeconfig Secret. See design-proposals/compute-plane in cozystack/community.                                                                                     | `bool`                | `false` |
| `schedulingClass` | The name of a SchedulingClass CR to apply scheduling constraints for this tenant's workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `string`              | `""`    |

## Configuration

### Resource Quotas

The `resourceQuotas` parameter allows you to limit resources available to the tenant. Supported keys include:

**Compute resources** (converted to `requests.X` and `limits.X`):
- `cpu` - Total CPU cores (e.g., `"4"` or `"500m"`)
- `memory` - Total memory (e.g., `"4Gi"` or `"512Mi"`)
- `ephemeral-storage` - Ephemeral storage limit (e.g., `"10Gi"`)
- `storage` - Total persistent storage (e.g., `"100Gi"`)

**Object count quotas** (passed as-is):
- `pods` - Maximum number of pods
- `services` - Maximum number of services
- `services.loadbalancers` - Maximum number of LoadBalancer services
- `services.nodeports` - Maximum number of NodePort services
- `configmaps` - Maximum number of ConfigMaps
- `secrets` - Maximum number of Secrets
- `persistentvolumeclaims` - Maximum number of PVCs

**Example:**
```yaml
resourceQuotas:
  cpu: 4
  memory: 4Gi
  storage: 10Gi
  services.loadbalancers: "3"
  pods: "50"
```
