# Managed Valkey Service

Valkey is a highly versatile and blazing-fast in-memory data store and cache that can significantly boost the performance of your applications. It is the BSD-3-Clause licensed, Linux Foundation-governed fork of Redis 7.2 and a drop-in replacement for it. Managed Valkey Service offers a hassle-free solution for deploying and managing Valkey clusters, ensuring that your data is always available and responsive.

## Deployment Details

Service runs Valkey on the freshworks-oss redis-operator, which manages Sentinel-based HA and selects the Valkey engine natively via `spec.engine: Valkey` — so the official `valkey/valkey` image is used directly, with no Redis-compatibility shim.

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.

## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
Every resource it leaves unset is taken from the preset defined in `resourcesPreset`.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m
  memory: 4Gi
```

`resourcesPreset` sets named CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
This setting is ignored if the corresponding `resources` value is set.

Presets follow a cloud-style `<series>.<size>` naming convention. Five series cover the full CPU-to-memory ratio range (`t1` 1:0.5, `c1` 1:1, `s1` 1:2, `u1` 1:4, `m1` 1:8) and each series ships eight sizes (`nano` through `4xlarge`). The legacy flat names (`nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`) remain accepted as deprecated aliases and keep their original sizes, which do not follow one series: `nano` through `small` equal the `t1` sizes of the same name, while `medium` equals `c1.small` rather than `c1.medium`.

See [`docs/operations/resource-presets.md`](../../../docs/operations/resource-presets.md) for the full size matrix and the legacy-to-instance-type mapping.
