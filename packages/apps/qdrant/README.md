# Managed Qdrant Service

Qdrant is a high-performance vector database and similarity search engine designed for AI and machine learning applications. It provides efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors with advanced filtering capabilities, making it ideal for recommendation systems, semantic search, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

## Deployment Details

Service deploys Qdrant as a StatefulSet with automatic cluster mode when multiple replicas are configured.

- GitHub: https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.

| `external`         | Enable external access from outside the cluster.                                                                                 | `bool`     | `false`    |


### TLS parameters

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| `tls`         | TLS configuration. When omitted, the effective TLS state follows the value of `external`.                                                              | `object` | `{}`   |
| `tls.enabled` | Enable TLS. When unset, inherits the value of `external` (TLS is on when external access is enabled). Set explicitly to `true` or `false` to override. | `*bool`  | `null` |


## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
Every resource it leaves unset is taken from the preset defined in `resourcesPreset`.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m
  memory: 4Gi
```

`resourcesPreset` sets named CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
This setting is ignored if the corresponding `resources` value is set.

Presets follow a cloud-style `<series>.<size>` naming convention. Five series cover the full CPU-to-memory ratio range (`t1` 1:0.5, `c1` 1:1, `s1` 1:2, `u1` 1:4, `m1` 1:8) and each series ships eight sizes (`nano` through `4xlarge`). The legacy flat names (`nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`) remain accepted as deprecated aliases and keep their original sizes, which do not follow one series: `nano` through `small` equal the `t1` sizes of the same name, while `medium` equals `c1.small` rather than `c1.medium`.

See [`docs/operations/resource-presets.md`](../../../docs/operations/resource-presets.md) for the full size matrix and the legacy-to-instance-type mapping.

### tls

With TLS on, the chart issues the server certificate from a self-signed CA it creates per release. The trust anchor for verifying that certificate is published as `qdrant-<name>.tenant-ca`, where `<name>` is the name of the `Qdrant` resource: an object holding `ca.crt` and nothing else, delivered to tenants through the `core.cozystack.io/tenantsecrets` API that the base tenant roles already grant.

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> --namespace <tenant> \
  get tenantsecret qdrant-<name>.tenant-ca \
  --output jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
```

It is the only object that hands over the CA certificate without also handing over a private key, which is why it exists. The `qdrant-<name>-ca` Secret the chart creates stores the CA **private key** alongside the certificate — read access to it would let the holder issue certificates for anything, so it is never granted to a tenant.

It is reached through `tenantsecrets` rather than by reading the Secret directly, and that is deliberate: `tenantsecrets` surfaces only objects the platform has vouched for (those the application's definition selects), whereas a direct grant on the name would convey whatever happens to occupy that name.
