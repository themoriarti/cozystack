rabbitmq.tls.enabled resolves tls.enabled to the string "true" or "false" so
callers can compare with `eq`:

  {{- $tlsEnabled := (include "rabbitmq.tls.enabled" .) | eq "true" -}}

TLS is opt-in: unset, null and false all resolve to false, and nothing else turns
it on — in particular `external` does not, unlike the sibling nats and qdrant
charts. See README "TLS scope" for why.

Every template that branches on TLS calls this helper, so they cannot disagree
about whether TLS is on; tests/tls_resolution_test.yaml pins that agreement.

The `dig` on a defaulted dict is load-bearing: `tls: null` in a HelmRelease
override never arrives as a null, because Helm's coalescing drops the key
outright, so `.Values.tls` is nil rather than an empty dict and reading
`.Values.tls.enabled` off it panics with "nil pointer evaluating interface
{}.enabled". The kindIs check then covers the ordinary path, where `tls: {}`
from values.yaml makes dig return its nil default.
