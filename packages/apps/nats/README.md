# Managed NATS Service

NATS is an open-source, simple, secure, and high performance messaging system.
It provides a data layer for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.

## Parameter examples and reference

### resources and resourcesPreset

`resources` sets explicit CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
Every resource it leaves unset is taken from the preset defined in `resourcesPreset`.

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 4000m
  memory: 4Gi
```

`resourcesPreset` sets named CPU and memory configurations for each replica.
This setting is ignored if the corresponding `resources` value is set.

Presets follow a cloud-style `<series>.<size>` naming convention. Five series cover the full CPU-to-memory ratio range (`t1` 1:0.5, `c1` 1:1, `s1` 1:2, `u1` 1:4, `m1` 1:8) and each series ships eight sizes (`nano` through `4xlarge`). The legacy flat names (`nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`) remain accepted as deprecated aliases and keep their original sizes, which do not follow one series: `nano` through `small` equal the `t1` sizes of the same name, while `medium` equals `c1.small` rather than `c1.medium`.

See [`docs/operations/resource-presets.md`](../../../docs/operations/resource-presets.md) for the full size matrix and the legacy-to-instance-type mapping.

### tls

`tls.enabled` is tri-state. Left unset it follows `external`, so TLS is enabled automatically for a NATS instance exposed outside the cluster and disabled for one that is not. Setting it explicitly overrides that in either direction.

When TLS is on, the chart issues a self-signed CA and a server certificate from it, and NATS serves the client port on `:4222` with the server certificate.

**Retrieving the CA certificate** for client verification:

The trust anchor is published as `nats-<name>.tenant-ca`: an object holding `ca.crt` and nothing else, delivered to tenants through the `core.cozystack.io/tenantsecrets` API that the base tenant roles already grant. It exists only while TLS is on, because that is the only state in which the chart issues a CA to publish.

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> --namespace <tenant> \
  get tenantsecret nats-<name>.tenant-ca \
  --output jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
```

`nats-<name>.tenant-ca` is the only object that hands over the CA certificate without also handing over a private key, which is why it exists. The chart's own `nats-<name>-ca` Secret stores the CA **private key** under `tls.key` alongside the certificate — read access to it would let the holder issue certificates for anything, so it is never granted to a tenant. The same applies to `nats-<name>-tls`, which holds the server's private key.

It is reached through `tenantsecrets` rather than by reading the Secret directly, and that is deliberate: `tenantsecrets` surfaces only objects the platform has vouched for, whereas a direct grant on the name would convey whatever happens to occupy that name.
