# Code of Conduct

Cozystack follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

# Cozystack Vendor Neutrality Manifesto

Cozystack exists for the cloud-native community. We are committed to a project culture where no single company, product, or commercial agenda directs our roadmap, governance, brand, or releases. Our North Star is user value, technical excellence, and open collaboration under the CNCF umbrella.

## Our Commitments

- **Community-first:** Decisions prioritize the broader community over any vendor interest.
- **Open collaboration:** Ideas, discussions, and outcomes happen in public spaces; contributions are welcomed from all.
- **Merit over affiliation:** Proposals are evaluated on technical merit and user impact, not on who submits them.
- **Inclusive stewardship:** Leadership and maintenance are open to contributors who demonstrate sustained, constructive impact.
- **Technology choice:** We prefer open, pluggable designs that interoperate with multiple ecosystems and providers.
- **Neutral brand & voice:** Our name, logo, website, and documentation do not imply endorsement or preference for any vendor.
- **Transparent practices:** Funding acknowledgments, partnerships, and potential conflicts are communicated openly.
- **User trust:** Security handling, releases, and communications aim to be timely, transparent, and fair to all users.

By contributing to Cozystack, we affirm these principles and work together to keep the project open, welcoming, and vendor-neutral.
