// the platform accepts do not issue a wildcard through that challenge
// (Let's Encrypt, Challenge Types: "This challenge cannot be used to
// issue wildcard certificates"), so the order would never complete and
// the listener would reference a Secret that never arrives; the
// wildcard modes serve such a route from the apex-wide listener
// instead. That refusal is a statement about the terminate listener
// rather than about the route, so it is judged where that listener is
// decided rather than at the top: the port-80 listener carries no
// hostname and serves a wildcard claim like any other, and a route
// selecting it never needed the listener HTTP-01 cannot supply. No
// overlap is read either way, because no listener setting changes it.
// A parentRef port
// attaches the route to the listeners on that port alone, so a port the
// terminate listener is not published on is judged the way servableOn
// judges it for a TLSRoute, with the one port the Gateway answers HTTP
// on read for what it is: the port-80 listener carries no hostname and
// admits httpListenerNamespaces alone. A route selects it by pinning
// its port, by naming it, or both; from one of those namespaces the
// route is served plain, from anywhere else the listener turns it away
// and it is told so, and a name and a port that select different
// listeners, http with port 443 for one, select none, which Gateway API
// requires when both are given. The solver route cert-manager writes
// for the ACME challenge names the listener without a port, from the
// namespace the Certificate lives in, so it is served plain.
//
// A sectionName outside the passthrough prefix and not http names a
// listener family this pass is still deciding, and such a route is left

// port-80 one, or, for an HTTPRoute pinning a passthrough listener,
// being unable to serve its kind; and NoMatchingParent, for a
// sectionName naming a passthrough listener this Gateway does not
// render, or a sectionName and a parentRef port that select different
// listeners, which is what Gateway API calls a parentRef whose port or
// section matches no listener. The rest land on
// NoMatchingListenerHostname, which is where the residue goes rather
// than a shape in its own right; the shapes are enumerated on the
// withdrawalCause constants, so a cause added later cannot slip past a
// list here that nobody updated. Reading that reason as the absence of
// a listener is wrong for most of what reaches it: a passthrough
// listener answers the SNI and, in the port-443 form, admits routes
// from every namespace attached to this Gateway, and a listener a route
// pins by the wrong sectionName or the wrong parentRef port is rendered
// and serving, just not to this route. Either way the route condition is the only
// object left that can say why, the listener that used to carry a
// condition of its own having gone with it.
//
// A write that fails is returned, after every other route has had its
// write, rather than logged. Returned, because the condition is the
// only object saying why a hostname stopped being served, and a pass
// that reports success over a lost write leaves the route reading
// Accepted=True until the resync; failing the reconcile puts the write
// under its own requeue. After the others, because one route's
// conflict is no reason to leave the rest a pass behind.

// Edge renders no TLS-passthrough listener, so every attached TLSRoute
// pins a section that is gone and is told so. NoMatchingParent is
// Gateway API's reason for a parentRef whose port or sectionName
// matches no listener on the Gateway, which is what the platform's own
// api, vm-exportproxy and cdi-uploadproxy routes now have: all three
// pin sectionName tls-<svc>.
//
// The other whole-apex modes render those listeners and serve them, but
// this controller collects no claims there and so has no basis to judge
// any TLSRoute. It therefore owns no condition on them, and drops the
// one it wrote while the tenant ran edge. Leaving that behind inverts
// the problem the withdrawal exists for: a served endpoint reported as
// matching no parent, with a message naming a class provider that no
// longer terminates anything.
//
// HTTP-01 is not handled here at all: it collects claims, so
// updateRouteStatuses has already judged every route this pass would
// have anything to say about.
//
// The refusal skips a route that declares no hostnames. Under HTTP-01
// such a route is judged on the hostname the listener it selects lends
// it, but that substitution needs a rendered passthrough listener, and
// these modes are exactly the ones where the route's sectionName may
// name none. A refusal written here would then have no path back: the
// HTTP-01 pass judges only routes that produced a claim, so a route
// pinned to a section it renders no listener for would carry an edge
// refusal after the tenant moved off edge. The drop does not skip it:
// the HTTP-01 pass did judge it, on the lent name, and that verdict
// has no other way out once the mode moves, so what edge writes on such
// a route is no opinion rather than a refusal.
//
// HTTPRoutes are dropped in every whole-apex mode. Every condition this
// controller writes on one is written under HTTP-01, where the claims
// pass runs, and the whole-apex modes serve those routes from the
// apex-wide listener, so a verdict left standing describes a listener
// set that no longer exists: a wildcard refused under http01 kept
// saying http01 could not terminate it while dns01 was serving it. The
// redirect route this controller renders never carries an entry of its
// own, so it is skipped rather than read.
