// involved, so the set is known before any claim is collected.
//
// A hostname one of these answers is reserved: none of them may also
// get an HTTPS-terminate listener, and the reason differs by field
// only in which layer refuses.
//
// A TLSPassthroughServices entry shares port 443 with the terminate
// listeners, so a hostname claimed by both produces two listeners on one
// port under one name. Gateway API admits the pair and then requires
// both to report Conflicted, after which neither serves. What the pinned
// Cilium does with it is a different question, and the two answers are
// one patch release apart: v1.19.5 has no Conflicted condition at all —
// setListenerStatus in operator/pkg/gateway-api/gateway_reconcile.go
// writes Accepted, Programmed and ResolvedRefs and nothing else — so the
// pair reaches Envoy as two filter chains whose FilterChainMatch carries
// one transport protocol and one server name. v1.19.6 adds
// samePortCrossProtocolConflictedListeners, which finds the pair from
// the listener specs alone and marks both Conflicted and not Accepted.
// So on the pin the collision is invisible on the objects, and on the
// next patch release the declaration alone is enough to kill both.
//
// A TLSPassthroughListeners entry sits on its own port, and that is not
// the protection it looks like on the Cilium this repo pins. v1.19.5
// (packages/system/cilium/images/cilium/Dockerfile) translates the whole
// Gateway into a single Envoy listener and hangs the ports off
// AdditionalAddresses; toFilterChainMatch in
// operator/pkg/model/translation/envoy_listener.go matches on
// transport_protocol and server_names and nothing else, so the Gateway
// listener's port never reaches the match. Two chains carrying one SNI
// from two Gateway ports become two chains with identical criteria in one
// Envoy listener. Upstream says what that costs, in
// operator/pkg/model/model.go on v1.19.6, above NeedsCrossProtocolSplit:
// a combined Envoy listener "would otherwise erase the original Gateway
// listener port boundary and route traffic for one listener to another".
// v1.19.6 answers it by splitting the Envoy listeners per port when
// NeedsPerPortListeners holds, which needs a TLSRoute behind the
// native-port listener before that listener counts at all; v1.19.5
// has neither the split nor the diagnostic, so the answer here is to
// keep the pair from being rendered. Revisit when the pin moves.
//
// The cost is that an HTTPRoute claiming a hostname declared here gets
// no listener wherever a TLSRoute is servable on the overlapping entry.
// Nothing hostile is needed to reach that: tlsPassthroughServices is a
// chart value shipped defaulted to api, vm-exportproxy and
// cdi-uploadproxy, so a tenant app named after one of them collides with
// a platform default. Suppression is not what breaks that hostname —
// the same collision already rendered a terminate listener and a
// passthrough listener under one SNI, and with a route on the
// passthrough side which of them answered was not something the objects
// said. The declaration on its own is a different case, which is why the
// reconciler keys the withdrawal on the routes rather than on the spec:
// a listener nothing attaches to puts no chain on the name, so the
// terminate listener answers it and keeps it.
//
// What the withdrawal takes away is the record of the collision on the
// Gateway, which on the pin is nothing and on v1.19.6 would be the
// Conflicted condition. updateRouteStatuses puts it on the route
// instead, as Accepted=False with NoMatchingListenerHostname naming the
// passthrough hostname that answers the claim.
//
// The caller matches a claimed hostname against these by SNI overlap
// rather than by equality, because a "*.db.<apex>" entry answers
// "pg.db.<apex>" on the pinned Cilium exactly as an explicit entry would:
// the filter chain match carries ServerNames and no port. Comparing by
// equality leaves that pair rendered and exposed to the translation this
// filter exists to avoid. What the overlap settles is which entry
// answers a claim, not on its own whether the claim is withdrawn: a name
// beneath a wildcard entry loses its terminate listener once a TLSRoute
// claiming that same name can be served on the entry, which is the pair
// whose two chains carry one server name. A TLSRoute on the wildcard
// itself is a different chain, and Envoy separates a wildcard from an
// exact server name by specificity rather than by refusing the pair.
