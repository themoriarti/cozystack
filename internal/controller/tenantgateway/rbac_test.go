// clusterRolePath is the ClusterRole the cozystack-controller chart
// ships. It is written by hand: the kubebuilder rbac markers in this
// package document the grants but generate nothing, because
// hack/update-codegen.sh runs controller-gen over ./api/... only and
// writes no rbac artifact anywhere. Nothing but this test connects the
// two.

// TestShippedClusterRoleNamesEveryTypeThisControllerReads pins that
// each type this reconciler watches or reads has a rule naming its API
// group, rather than reaching the apiserver only through the
// read-everything rule at the foot of the ClusterRole.
//
// An informer that starts without a grant fails with Forbidden and
// takes the manager down with it, and the failure arrives whenever
// someone narrows that catch-all, long after the watch that needed it
// was added. A rule naming the group is what survives that edit.
//
// Resource wildcards inside a named group are accepted: the rule
// covering this project's own CRDs is written that way, and narrowing
// the catch-all does not touch it. An apiGroups entry of "*" is not,
// because it is the rule this test exists to stop the controller
// depending on.
//
// The template is parsed as YAML rather than rendered, which holds
// because it carries no Helm actions. Putting one in it, a
// {{/* */}} comment included, means rendering the chart here instead.
