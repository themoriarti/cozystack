# Kafka topic-data backup/restore example

This directory shows how to back up and restore the **topic data** of a Cozystack-managed `Kafka` application using the **generic `Job` backup strategy**. Unlike the app-specific drivers (Altinity for ClickHouse, CNPG for Postgres, ...), the `Job` strategy has no built-in knowledge of the application: it runs a Pod the operator supplies. Here that Pod is a stock [Strimzi Kafka image][strimzi-image] (which carries the `kafka-*.sh` CLI plus `bash`, `curl` and `tar`) running one shell script:

- **backup**: freeze each partition's end offset, drain `[begin, end)` with `kafka-console-consumer` → `tar` → `PUT` the tarball to S3.
- **restore**: `GET` the tarball from S3 → `tar -x` → recreate the topics with their original partition count → replay every partition file with `kafka-console-producer`.

The same `PodTemplateSpec` serves both directions. The strategy engine templates each string field independently — it cannot add or remove containers per mode — so the single image branches at runtime on `{{ .Mode }}` (rendered into the `MODE` env var). Backup pushes to a key scoped by the source app (`{{ .Release.Name }}`); restore reads the key scoped by the backup's source (`{{ .Backup.ApplicationRef.Name }}`), so a to-copy restore lands the source's data into a differently-named target. The upload uses `curl --aws-sigv4`, so no purpose-built backup image is needed — a stock client image plus a shell script is the whole driver.

## Consistency model

The backup takes a **frozen-end-offset cut**. For each topic the driver reads every partition's end offset once (`kafka-get-offsets --time -1`) and its begin offset (`--time -2`), then drains only up to the frozen end. Anything produced after that read (offset ≥ the frozen end) is excluded, so a topic's partitions are captured as of the same instant — a coherent point-in-time view of that topic. The reads happen per topic, so the cut is atomic within a topic but not across topics (Kafka offers no cross-topic guarantee regardless). This needs no dependency on record timestamps: it is a cut by log position, not by wall-clock time.

## Scope and limitations

This is a **logical DATA backup**, deliberately narrow — it captures topic records (key + value) and nothing else:

- **Not captured**: topic configs (retention, compaction, `min.insync.replicas`), ACLs, SCRAM users, and **consumer-group offsets**. Restore recreates each topic with only its original partition count and the configured replication factor (`replicationFactor`, default `1`) — the source RF is not captured, so restoring into a multi-broker cluster without raising that parameter is a silent durability downgrade.
- **Offsets change on restore**: restore re-produces records, so the target assigns fresh offsets. A consumer group's committed position from the source is therefore meaningless on the restored cluster. Preserving consumer offsets requires either offset translation or a byte-identical volume-snapshot restore (Velero/CSI) — neither is in scope here.
- **Topic names are matched literally**: `kafka-topics` and `kafka-get-offsets` treat `--topic` as a Java regex, so a name carrying a metacharacter would otherwise select its siblings (`audit.events` also matches `audit-events`) — deleting, measuring or backing up the wrong topic. Every filtering call here pins the name with `\Q...\E`; `--create` and the console producer/consumer take a literal name and are left unquoted. The demo is set up so this cannot silently regress: the topic is `orders.v1` and a decoy `orders-v1` sits beside it, matching the first as a regex but not as a literal. The decoy is never named in the `BackupClass`, so a correct run leaves it untouched — drop a pin and the run fails on its own: the partition-set guard counts the decoy's partitions, the in-place step's `--delete` takes the decoy with it, or a `--describe` reads the decoy's `PartitionCount`. That last one is why the decoy is named to sort *before* the topic (`-` precedes `.`): both `--describe` reads take `head -1`, so a decoy sorting after them would leave those two pins unexercised.
- **Fidelity**: records are round-tripped as `key<TAB>value` text via the console tools, so keys and values must be newline- and tab-free. Message headers and record timestamps are not preserved. A production driver would use a binary-safe client (e.g. a purpose-built image) for arbitrary payloads.
- **Compacted and transactional topics are out of scope**: the drain reads exactly `end - begin` records per partition, which equals the consumable count only on a plain topic. On a compacted topic (sparse offsets) or one written by transactional producers (control markers occupy offsets but are never delivered), fewer records are consumable. `kafka-console-consumer` does not report this — it idles to its `--timeout-ms` and still exits 0 — so the strategy compares the drained line count against `end - begin` and **fails the backup** on any shortfall rather than uploading a partial tarball. The partition *set* is checked the same way, because `kafka-get-offsets` lists only the partitions whose lookup succeeded and still exits 0: the number of partitions it returned is compared against the topic's own `PartitionCount`, so one skipped by a leader election mid-backup fails the run instead of silently vanishing from it. Note the interaction with the parameter default: an empty `topics` backs up *every* non-internal topic, so the all-topics setting is the riskiest, not the safest — one compacted or transactional topic in the namespace aborts the whole run. Restrict `topics` to topics you know are plain, or accept that the default may fail closed. Conversely, if `topics` is empty and the namespace holds only internal topics, the loop backs up nothing: an empty tarball is uploaded and the `Backup` reports `Succeeded`. That is correct for a genuinely empty cluster, but confirm the source actually held user topics before trusting such a run — the restore side refuses such an artifact outright (`manifest is empty`), so an empty backup is not a restorable one.
- **Partition placement**: keyed records re-produce into the same partition because the topic is recreated with the same partition count and the default (murmur2) partitioner is deterministic. Null-key records fare worse: the dump renders a null key as the literal string `null` (the console formatter's default) and the replay reads it back as a four-byte `null` key — so the record not only lands in an unpredictable partition but has its key changed from null to `"null"`, which shifts its compaction identity downstream.
- **Restore appends, it does not replace**: the driver creates the topic only if absent (`--create --if-not-exists`) and then replays every record, so restoring into a topic that still holds data adds to it rather than overwriting. Restore is safe only against an absent or empty topic — the in-place step below deletes the topic first for exactly this reason. An empty topic is not enough on its own: `--if-not-exists` leaves a pre-existing topic's partition count alone, which would silently re-place every keyed record, so the driver also compares the target's `PartitionCount` against the backup and refuses a differently shaped topic. The driver enforces that: it reads the target's record count before replaying and refuses a topic that already holds data, so the strategy Job's `backoffLimit: 2` — which retries a Pod that died mid-replay — cannot stack a second copy on top of a partial one. The retry stops at the check with the topic as the failed attempt left it; empty or delete the topic and re-run. The post-replay count check then still verifies what landed.
- **Each backup overwrites the previous one**: the S3 object key is `<namespace>/<app>/kafka-topics.tar` with no run identifier, so every `Backup` of the same application resolves to the same tarball and restoring an older `Backup` restores the latest data. The generic `Job` driver exposes no unique per-run handle at backup time — the `Backup` artifact is created only after the Job completes — so a per-run key would need a driver change.
- **Local disk usage is unbounded**: the drain stages the whole topic under `/tmp` and then again as a tarball on the Pod's writable layer, and the strategy Pod requests no `ephemeral-storage`. A large topic can fill the node's ephemeral storage and evict other Pods; set an `ephemeral-storage` request and limit sized to your data before backing up anything substantial.
- **TLS verification is disabled for S3**: the strategy calls `curl -k`, so the upload and download are encrypted but the endpoint's certificate is not checked — it accepts the self-signed cert the in-cluster seaweedfs presents, and would equally accept an impostor. That is acceptable for a same-tenant Service and not for anything crossing a network you do not control: mount the tenant CA into the strategy Pod and drop `-k` before pointing this at an external endpoint.
- **Pod Security**: the strategy Pod and the demo's throwaway CLI Pods set `runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, drop all capabilities and a `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile, so they satisfy the `restricted` Pod Security Standard on the stock Strimzi image, which runs as non-root UID 1001. Pinning an image that runs as root would need a `runAsUser` suited to that image instead.

For a faithful, offset-preserving Kafka backup, prefer a volume-snapshot strategy over this logical one; this example exists to show the generic `Job` path end to end.

## Running

```sh
# Uses NAMESPACE=tenant-test by default; override any knob via the environment.
./run-all.sh
# ... or step by step, in numeric order.
./cleanup.sh
```

By default the scripts resolve `KAFKA_IMAGE` from the running Strimzi operator — the newest image in its `STRIMZI_KAFKA_IMAGES` map — so the backup Pod reuses an image already cached on the nodes with no extra pull or version skew. Set `KAFKA_IMAGE` explicitly to pin a different one, for example on an air-gapped clone where the operator cannot be read (the backup Pod only needs the `kafka-*.sh` CLI plus `curl` and `tar`). To see what the operator ships:

```sh
kubectl -n cozy-kafka-operator get deploy strimzi-cluster-operator \
  -o jsonpath='{range .spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[*]}{.name}={.value}{"\n"}{end}' | grep KAFKA_IMAGES
```
