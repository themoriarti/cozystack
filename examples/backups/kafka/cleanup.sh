# `kubectl delete` returns as soon as deletionTimestamp is set, while the
# HelmRelease uninstall behind each Kafka app (two StatefulSets, ZooKeeper and
# their PVCs) is still draining. Returning here lets the next suite start into a
# namespace whose predecessor is still uninstalling - the neighbouring
# chainsaw/kafka Test's PVC-reclaim step contends with exactly that. Wait for
# the heavy objects to actually go, and with teeth: without `set -e` an absent
# resource cannot abandon the rest of the teardown, so the waits record their
# own failure and the script exits non-zero when the teardown did not settle.
