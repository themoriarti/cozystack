# Reuse the image the platform's own cozy-default-altinity strategy runs, so the
# demo Pod needs no `apk add` at run time. That matters twice over: the strategy
# runs once per BackupJob and RestoreJob, so fetching packages from the Alpine
# CDN each time makes every backup depend on outbound internet — it fails
# outright on an air-gapped cluster, and it turns a CDN hiccup into a failed
# backup — and this same script is the e2e round-trip's harness, where that
# would surface as an unrelated red E2E run.
#
# Read it off the shipped strategy rather than hardcoding a tag, so the demo
# tracks whatever the platform is pinned to. Falls back to alpine + `apk add`
# only when that strategy is absent (a cluster without the backupstrategy
# controller chart), which is also the one case where the demo has to bootstrap
# its own tooling.
