# Backup Classes

Cozystack ships a single platform-managed `BackupClass` named `cozy-default`. It is provisioned automatically when the `backupstrategy-controller` package is installed and references the system-managed bucket provisioned through the `apps.cozystack.io/Bucket` CR `cozy-backups` in the `tenant-root` namespace (the real S3 bucket name is the COSI-assigned one from `BucketClaim.status.bucketName`).

Tenants reference `cozy-default` from `BackupJob`, `Plan`, and `RestoreJob` resources — they do **not** supply S3 credentials, endpoints, or paths. The platform projects the system-managed credentials Secret into the tenant namespace per BackupJob (or, for long-lived references like Velero's `BackupStorageLocation`, into a fixed list of system namespaces on a periodic tick), and the default strategy templates encode `<namespace>/<application>` into every S3 path so two tenants with the same application name never collide.

| `apps.cozystack.io/FoundationDB` | FoundationDB operator backup_agent   | `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/FoundationDB` `cozy-default-foundationdb`   |

The FoundationDB strategy CR is rendered by the chart so admins can reference it from a custom BackupClass once the operator-side plumbing (mounting `cozy-backups-creds` into the `cozy-foundationdb-operator` Deployment) is wired manually. See "FoundationDB caveat" below.

### Endpoint format per driver

Different operators expect different endpoint shapes; the strategy templates rendered by `backupstrategy-controller` resolve one S3 endpoint (via the `backupstrategy-controller.endpoint` helper) and adapt it to each consumer's contract. For a provisioned bucket (`provisionBucket: true`, the default) the endpoint is **derived from the COSI bucket's system-credentials Secret** (`backupStorage.systemSecretName`) and forced to `https://` — the external S3 ingress with an ACME cert, the only endpoint the backup operators can verify. SeaweedFS's in-cluster S3 serves TLS on `:8333` behind the self-signed "SeaweedFS CA", and the Etcd Strategy S3 schema has no `caCert` field, so the in-cluster endpoint cannot be targeted directly. The `backupStorage.endpoint` chart value (a full URL like `http://seaweedfs-s3.tenant-root.svc:8333`) is the **fallback**, used for external S3 (`provisionBucket: false`) and for offline `helm template`/pre-reconcile renders where the Secret lookup returns nothing. The resolved endpoint is adapted per consumer:

| Driver | Strategy template field | Form |
|--------|-------------------------|------|
| CNPG (Postgres) | `barmanObjectStore.endpointURL` | full URL (scheme preserved) |
| Etcd            | `destination.s3.endpoint`       | full URL (scheme preserved) |
| MariaDB         | `storage.s3.endpoint`           | bare host:port (scheme stripped); `tls.enabled` derived from the scheme |
| FoundationDB    | `blobStoreConfiguration.accountName` + `urlParameters.secure_connection` | bare host:port + derived secure flag |
| Velero          | `BackupStorageLocation.spec.config.s3Url` | full URL (scheme preserved) |
| ClickHouse sidecar | `S3_ENDPOINT` env | bare host:port (from projected Secret) |

The projected `cozy-backups-creds.endpoint` key is **stripped of scheme** so chart-emitted sidecars (ClickHouse) consume it directly. Drivers that need the full URL receive the resolved endpoint described above — derived from the COSI system Secret (forced `https://`) for a provisioned bucket, or the `backupStorage.endpoint` fallback for external S3.

VM-driven (Velero) backups land in the same `cozy-backups` bucket under the `velero/` prefix. A `BackupStorageLocation` named `cozy-default` is shipped by the `backupstrategy-controller` chart (`packages/system/backupstrategy-controller/templates/velero-bsl.yaml`) so endpoint/bucket/region come from the same `backupStorage` values block used by Strategy CRs and the projector.

### FoundationDB caveat

The strategy CR `cozy-default-foundationdb` is shipped, but it is **not** bound by `cozy-default` yet. Restore runs `fdbrestore` from inside the `cozy-foundationdb-operator` Deployment, which does not yet mount `cozy-backups-creds`. Until the operator deployment is updated to mount the projected Secret, FDB platform-default restore silently fails — admins who need it today should keep using a per-app `Bucket` plus a custom `BackupClass`, or wire the credentials file into the operator deployment themselves.

**Cleanup gotcha (zombie backup_agent).** Unlike CNPG/MariaDB/Altinity (one-shot operator-side Backup CRs), the FoundationDB driver creates an `apps.foundationdb.org/FoundationDBBackup` CR that drives a **long-lived** `backup_agent` Deployment streaming continuously to S3. Deleting a Cozystack `Backup` (e.g. via retention sweeping) does NOT stop that Deployment — the agent keeps writing until the next BackupJob's `stopOtherFoundationDBBackups` call swaps it out, until an admin invokes `examples/backups/foundationdb/cleanup.sh`, or until the operator-side CR is deleted by hand. If a tenant deletes their last Cozystack Backup and never submits another BackupJob, the agent pods will continue running indefinitely and accumulate S3 PUTs. This is intentional today (the driver has no RBAC verb to stop the operator-side CR on Cozystack-Backup deletion) but admins should be aware of it.

## ClickHouse: opt-in to the system bucket

The `clickhouse-backup` sidecar runs inside the ClickHouse Pod itself, so the Helm chart is what wires its S3 credentials. Existing tenants on the legacy `backup.s3*` values continue to work unchanged. To switch a release onto the platform bucket, set:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  useSystemBucket: true
```

When `useSystemBucket: true`:

- The chart-emitted `<release>-backup-s3` Secret is no longer rendered.
- The sidecar consumes `cozy-backups-creds` (projected by the platform).
- `S3_PATH` is set to `<namespace>/<release>` so two tenants with the same ClickHouse release name never share a prefix.

`s3Region`, `s3Bucket`, `endpoint`, `s3AccessKey`, `s3SecretKey`, and `s3CredentialsSecret` are ignored in this mode.

## Inspecting the defaults

```bash
kubectl get backupclasses
kubectl get backupclass cozy-default -o yaml
kubectl -n tenant-root get bucket cozy-backups
kubectl -n tenant-root get secret bucket-cozy-backups-system-credentials
kubectl -n cozy-velero get backupstoragelocation cozy-default
```

The bucket lives in `tenant-root` and is provisioned through the `apps.cozystack.io/Bucket` CR. The system-managed credentials Secret never leaves that namespace. The backupstrategy-controller projects a copy under the name `cozy-backups-creds` into a tenant namespace right before each BackupJob or RestoreJob runs, and refreshes the same Secret in `cozy-velero` (and any other namespace listed in `backupStorage.systemNamespaces`) on a 1-minute tick. The projected Secret carries multiple key formats so each driver finds what it needs in one place:

| Key                                           | Consumer                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | CNPG, MariaDB, Etcd                       |
| `accessKey` / `secretKey` (plus `bucketName`, `endpoint`, `region`) | ClickHouse sidecar  |
| `cloud`                                       | Velero (AWS credentials file format)      |
| `blob_credentials.json`                       | FoundationDB backup_agent                 |

### Bootstrap window

On a fresh-cluster install, the Velero `BackupStorageLocation` `cozy-default` is rendered before the credentials projector has had a chance to copy `cozy-backups-creds` into `cozy-velero`. The BSL reports `Unavailable` until the projector's first synchronous round completes (which runs as soon as the `backupstrategy-controller` acquires leadership — in practice moments after the Pod becomes Ready, typically tens of seconds after `helm install` returns, not minutes). Velero rejects new `Backup` AND `Restore` requests against `storageLocation: cozy-default` during that window. Plan VM backup automation accordingly, or wait for the BSL to become ready before submitting backups: `kubectl -n cozy-velero wait backupstoragelocation cozy-default --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Available --timeout=5m`.

**Note on controller restarts.** The BSL flickers `Unavailable` on every `backupstrategy-controller` pod restart while the projector replays its first synchronous round. The window is short (single-digit seconds) but operators who alert on BSL availability should suppress alerts during the controller's `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{container=backupstrategy-controller}` events or use a longer evaluation window than the projector tick (60s).

### Cozy-default Bucket bootstrap

`cozy-default` ships an `apps.cozystack.io/Bucket cozy-backups` CR in `tenant-root`, which the bucket-application chart turns into a `BucketClaim`; the COSI driver then assigns the real S3 bucket name (`bucket-<claim-UID>`, so it cannot be computed in advance) and writes it to the BucketClaim's `.status.bucketName`. The strategy templates and the Velero BSL all read that real bucket name (Helm `lookup` against the BucketClaim). On a fresh install the BucketClaim takes a reconcile cycle to populate its status — until it does, the strategy templates render empty and only the `Bucket` CR + `BackupClass` are present in the cluster.

**That skip does not repair itself on a reconcile.** helm-controller re-renders a release only when its chart or values change; the interval reconcile is a no-op for a healthy release, and drift detection is off on operator-generated HelmReleases. A cluster that lost the race at install time therefore keeps `BackupClass cozy-default` with **no** `Strategy` CRs and **no** Velero BSL indefinitely — which also fail-closes the pre-adoption snapshot in the v1.6.0 etcd migration.

The same trap sits one release earlier, on the Secret everything else depends on. `bucket-cozy-backups-system-credentials` is rendered by the `bucket-cozy-backups-system` release behind a `lookup` of the COSI Secret, and is skipped just as permanently when that lookup is empty. Without it the credentials projector has no source at all, so no strategy, no Velero and no v1.6.0 etcd migration can resolve — and the gate cannot even determine the bucket name, which it reads from that Secret.

Convergence is driven instead by the controller's default-objects gate (`backupStorage.reconcileDefaultObjects`, on by default), which repairs both, in order. While the credentials Secret is absent or carries no bucket name, the gate stamps `reconcile.fluxcd.io/forceAt` + `requestedAt` on the **bucket's** `bucket-<name>-system` HelmRelease. Once the bucket name resolves it checks that every object `cozy-default` routes to exists and stamps the same pair on the **`backupstrategy-controller`** HelmRelease, forcing the real Helm upgrade that re-runs the lookups. The two are throttled independently (one force per 5 minutes each), so the second is not delayed by the first. Expect the objects within a minute or two of the bucket becoming ready.

The gate does not force a suspended HelmRelease — helm-controller ignores both annotations while `spec.suspend` is true, so it logs the skip and leaves the force counter alone. A release left suspended (`cozyhr suspend`) is therefore never repaired until it is resumed.

Watch it with:

```bash
kubectl -n cozy-backup-controller logs deploy/backupstrategy-controller | grep default-objects-gate
```

#### Manual recovery on an affected cluster

Only needed on a cluster running a version without the gate (or with `reconcileDefaultObjects: false`). A plain `flux reconcile helmrelease` does **nothing** here — it does not re-render. You need a forced upgrade, and **both** annotations: `forceAt` is what makes helm-controller run a real Helm upgrade, and it is only honoured together with `requestedAt`.

First confirm the bucket name is actually resolvable — forcing before that just re-runs the same empty lookup:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root get bucketclaim bucket-cozy-backups -o jsonpath='{.status.bucketName}'
```

Then force the two releases, **in this order**:

```bash
# 1. The credentials Secret. It is rendered by the -system release, not by
#    bucket-cozy-backups — easy to miss, and the projector (hence every
#    strategy and Velero) has no source without it.
ts=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
kubectl -n tenant-root annotate helmrelease bucket-cozy-backups-system \
  reconcile.fluxcd.io/forceAt="$ts" reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt="$ts" --overwrite
kubectl -n tenant-root get secret bucket-cozy-backups-system-credentials

# 2. The Strategy CRs and the Velero BSL.
ts=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
kubectl -n cozy-backup-controller annotate helmrelease backupstrategy-controller \
  reconcile.fluxcd.io/forceAt="$ts" reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt="$ts" --overwrite
kubectl get $(kubectl get crd -o name | grep strategy.backups.cozystack.io) 2>/dev/null
kubectl -n cozy-velero get backupstoragelocation cozy-default
```

The race is nested: step 2's `lookup` resolves from the BucketClaim status, but the projector — and the v1.6.0 etcd migration — read the Secret from step 1, so a cluster missing both needs both.

### Observability

The credentials projector emits two Prometheus counters labelled by `namespace` (and `reason` for failures):

- `cozystack_backup_credentials_projection_successes_total`
- `cozystack_backup_credentials_projection_failures_total`

Alert on `rate(cozystack_backup_credentials_projection_failures_total[5m]) > 0` or `absent_over_time(cozystack_backup_credentials_projection_successes_total[10m])` to catch a stale BSL credential or a malformed source Secret without log scraping.

The default-objects gate emits three more:

- `cozystack_backup_default_objects_missing{backupclass="cozy-default"}` — how many of the objects the platform default backups depend on are absent: the credentials Secret, the Strategy CRs `cozy-default` routes to, and the Velero BSL. **This is the alert that would have caught the missing Strategy CRs**: it is non-zero whatever the HelmRelease's `Ready` condition says. Alert on `min_over_time(cozystack_backup_default_objects_missing[15m]) > 0`.
- `cozystack_backup_default_objects_check_errors_total{backupclass="cozy-default"}` — checks that could not reach a conclusion (an API error reading the source Secret, the BackupClass, or one of the routed objects). The gauge above is deliberately **not** written on those ticks, so that it does not flap on a transient API error — which means that while this counter climbs, the gauge is stale and a `0` on it proves nothing. Pair the two: `min_over_time(cozystack_backup_default_objects_missing[15m]) > 0 or rate(cozystack_backup_default_objects_check_errors_total[15m]) > 0`.
- `cozystack_backup_default_objects_force_reconciles_total{namespace,name}` — forced Helm upgrades issued, labelled by the release forced (this chart's own, or the bucket's `-system` release). A counter that keeps climbing means the forced render is not producing the objects (a missing CRD, for instance), which is a different problem from the install-time race. A suspended release is skipped before the patch and is **not** counted here, so a paused release cannot masquerade as a render that keeps failing — look for the `skipped forcing a suspended HelmRelease` log line instead.

## Admin overrides for `cozy-default`

`cozy-default` is rendered by the `backupstrategy-controller` chart and owned by Flux's helm-controller. **Direct `kubectl edit backupclass cozy-default` is overwritten on the next helm reconcile** — the same applies to its companion `strategy.backups.cozystack.io/*` CRs (`cozy-default-cnpg`, `cozy-default-etcd`, `cozy-default-mariadb`, `cozy-default-altinity`, `cozy-default-foundationdb`, the two `cozy-default-velero-*`). The supported override path is the `backupStorage` block on the **`platform` component** of the `cozystack.cozystack-platform` Package CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: cozystack.cozystack-platform
spec:
  components:
    platform:
      values:
        backupStorage:
          provisionBucket: true                    # default; set false for external S3
          bucketName: cozy-backups                  # apps.cozystack.io/Bucket release name
          endpoint: http://seaweedfs-s3.tenant-root.svc.cozy.local:8333
          region: us-east-1
          forcePathStyle: true
          systemSecretName: bucket-cozy-backups-system-credentials
          systemNamespaces:
            - cozy-velero
```

The platform chart forwards this block into the child `Package cozystack.backupstrategy-controller` as `components.backupstrategy-controller.values.backupStorage` (`packages/core/platform/templates/bundles/system.yaml`), from where the cozystack operator merges it into the `backupstrategy-controller` HelmRelease over the chart defaults. Two paths that look plausible do **not** work: `spec.components.backupstrategy-controller` on the `cozystack.cozystack-platform` Package is silently ignored (the only component under that PackageSource is `platform`), and patching the child `Package cozystack.backupstrategy-controller` directly is reverted whenever the platform helm-reconcile re-renders it.

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `provisionBucket` | Toggle creation of the in-cluster `apps.cozystack.io/Bucket` CR. Set `false` for external S3 (see [Disabling the platform-managed bucket](#disabling-the-platform-managed-bucket)). |
| `bucketName` | Two modes. With `provisionBucket: true` (default): K8s name of the Bucket CR + lookup key for the COSI BucketClaim — the actual S3 bucket name is the COSI-assigned UUID, surfaced through `BucketClaim.status.bucketName`. With `provisionBucket: false`: taken **verbatim as the real S3 bucket name** and baked into every strategy CR + the Velero BSL. |
| `namespace` | Namespace the Bucket CR (and its system-credentials Secret) lives in — `tenant-root` by default. Must be a tenant namespace (`tenant-*`): the Bucket chart's RBAC helper fails the Helm render for any other prefix. |
| `bucketNameOverride` | Escape hatch for offline `helm template` renders — bypasses the live-cluster BucketClaim lookup. Leave empty in production. |
| `endpoint` | **Fallback** S3 endpoint. For a provisioned bucket the strategy CRs + Velero BSL derive the endpoint from the COSI system Secret (external ACME ingress, forced `https://`) instead; this value is used only for external S3 (`provisionBucket: false`) and offline renders. For external S3, switching it to `https://` enables TLS in the MariaDB/FoundationDB strategies — ensure the CA bundle is reachable to the relevant operator/driver Pods first. |
| `region` | Re-projected into `cozy-backups-creds` on the next reconcile. Pod-restart required for chart-emitted clients consuming the region via env (ClickHouse sidecar today). |
| `forcePathStyle` | Path-style addressing; SeaweedFS S3 requires it, AWS S3 typically doesn't. |
| `systemSecretName` | Name of the human-friendly Secret produced by the Bucket app (or pre-created manually for external S3). The projector also accepts the raw COSI Secret format. |
| `systemNamespaces` | Namespaces where the controller eagerly projects `cozy-backups-creds` (Velero BSL, FDB operator). Tenants are projected lazily during BackupJob reconcile. |

When the override needs to go beyond storage coordinates — different retention, different driver→Kind binding, multi-region split — create a **sibling BackupClass** with a unique name (anything but `cozy-default`). Sibling BackupClasses live outside the chart, are admin-owned, and Flux will not touch them. Tenants opt in by setting `backupClassName: <your-class>` on their `BackupJob`s.

## Tuning via a custom BackupClass

The defaults aim at a reasonable middle (30-day retention, gzip compression where applicable). To override for a specific tenant or workload, create your own `BackupClass` pointing at the same strategy CRs but with tweaked `parameters`, or a fresh strategy CR. Common knobs:

- **CNPG strategy**: `barmanObjectStore.retentionPolicy`, `data.compression`, `wal.compression`.
- **MariaDB strategy**: `compression`, `maxRetention`, `databases[]`.
- **Altinity strategy**: tune the `clickhouse-backup` sidecar via `backup.*` values on the ClickHouse release; the strategy Pod is a thin HTTP client.
- **FoundationDB strategy**: `snapshotPeriodSeconds`, `agentCount`, `urlParameters[]`.
- **Velero strategy (VMInstance / VMDisk)**: `ttl`, `includedResources[]`, `excludedResources[]`.
- **Etcd strategy**: today the strategy is path-only; combine with `Plan.spec.retentionPolicy` for trim cadence.

The system-managed credentials Secret is the **only** way for in-cluster strategies to reach `cozy-backups`. Do not embed access keys in `BackupClass.parameters` — the security model relies on Secret references, and `parameters` end up in `Backup.status.underlyingResources`, which tenants can read.

## Disabling the platform-managed bucket

If a deployment runs against an external S3 (no SeaweedFS), set `backupStorage.provisionBucket: false` via the `platform` component override described above and create the source credentials Secret in `tenant-root` manually (flat-key format: `accessKey` / `secretKey` / `endpoint` / `bucketName`; or the raw COSI `BucketInfo` JSON). In the same `backupStorage` block, update `endpoint`, `region`, **and `bucketName`**: with `provisionBucket: false` the strategies and the Velero BSL take `bucketName` verbatim as the real S3 bucket name (no COSI lookup), so it must name the actual bucket on the external S3 — the `bucketName` key inside the Secret alone is not enough. The Velero `BackupStorageLocation` picks the same values up automatically (the chart renders it from the same `backupStorage` block), so no separate BSL configuration is needed. Note that disabling the cluster-default BSL itself (the chart's `velero.bslEnabled` value) is **not** carried by the `backupStorage` override path — the platform Package forwards only the `backupStorage` block.

## Upgrade notes from chart-managed backups

> **Postgres backups now use the CloudNativePG Barman Cloud plugin, not native `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`.**
>
> Postgres backups were migrated off the deprecated native `barmanObjectStore` (removed in CNPG 1.29) onto the [Barman Cloud plugin](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud). The `barman-cloud-*` binaries the native path needs are absent from the `standard` image variant `keycloak-db` pins; `apps/postgres` pins bare (system-flavor) tags that still ship them — its breakage was the operator/CRD skew below, not missing binaries — but the system flavor is deprecated upstream, so both move to the plugin. The chart now renders `spec.plugins` on the `cnpg.io/Cluster` plus a `barmancloud.cnpg.io/ObjectStore` CR that carries the S3 configuration, and the CNPG backup driver SSA-applies an `ObjectStore` and patches `spec.plugins` (instead of `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`) for the platform flow; `Backup`/`ScheduledBackup` use `method: plugin`. On `helm upgrade` a legacy chart-managed Cluster's `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore` is replaced by `spec.plugins` + an `ObjectStore`. This only works once the `plugin-barman-cloud` operator is installed and co-located with the CNPG operator in `cozy-postgres-operator` (shipped by the `postgres-operator` chart) and its cert-manager dependency is present — otherwise the Cluster references a plugin that is not registered and backups / WAL archiving stall.
>
> **Mixed-version window: BackupJobs fail until the app re-renders with the new chart.** A `BackupJob` that fires while a `Cluster` still carries the pre-upgrade chart's native `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore` is rejected by the CNPG admission webhook (`Cannot enable a WAL archiver plugin when barmanObjectStore is configured`) — the driver cannot attach `spec.plugins` alongside the native config. This resolves itself once Flux re-renders the Postgres app with the new chart (which replaces `barmanObjectStore` with `spec.plugins`); re-run the BackupJob afterward. Upgrading only the operators/driver without the app charts leaves every `backup.enabled: true` Postgres in this state permanently.
>
> **Postgres `backup.enabled: true` with placeholder credentials no longer wires backups on upgrade.**
>
> The pre-v1.5 defaults for `backup.s3AccessKey` / `backup.s3SecretKey` in `packages/apps/postgres/values.yaml` were the literal `"<your-access-key>"` / `"<your-secret-key>"` placeholders, so the Postgres chart still rendered a backup block on the `cnpg.io/Cluster` (with junk credentials, WAL archiving failing at runtime). Starting with v1.5 those defaults are empty strings and the chart NO LONGER renders any backup wiring when the placeholders are unmodified. Tenants on the legacy chart-managed flow who relied on those placeholders see `spec.plugins` and the `ObjectStore` disappear from the live `Cluster` on `helm upgrade`. Action — pick one:
>
> - **Move to the platform flow (recommended).** Set `backup.useSystemBucket: true`; the chart leaves `spec.plugins` unset and the CNPG backup driver SSA-applies the `ObjectStore` and patches `spec.plugins` onto the live `Cluster` at first BackupJob time. No tenant-side keys required.
> - **Stay on the legacy chart-managed flow.** Supply real `backup.s3AccessKey` / `backup.s3SecretKey` (or a pre-existing `backup.s3CredentialsSecret.name`); the chart renders `spec.plugins` + the `ObjectStore` from those coordinates.
>
> **Two platform-level changes ride along with this migration (they are required for the plugin to run):**
>
> - **CloudNativePG operator bumped to 1.28.1** (`postgres-operator` chart). A minor operator upgrade for the whole fleet; the CNPG CRDs move with it. This also fixes a latent bug where the operator image was newer than its bundled CRDs (`status.instanceID.sessionID` pruned), which made the operator believe the instance manager restarted and fail **every** backup cluster-wide with `instance manager was restarted during backup`. The vendored chart ships the CNPG CRDs as ordinary release manifests (gated by `crds.create`), so a normal `helm upgrade` updates them together with the operator — the `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation only prevents their deletion, not updates. The historical skew came from the `image.tag` pin outrunning the vendored chart's CRDs, which this PR removes; no out-of-band CRD apply is needed unless the HelmRelease itself is held back.
> - **LINSTOR scheduler admission webhook must not strip native-sidecar fields.** Older `linstor-scheduler` extender builds (≤ v0.3.5's predecessors) decoded every pod through a stale vendored Kubernetes API and re-encoded it, stripping `initContainers[].restartPolicy` cluster-wide — which breaks the plugin's restartable barman sidecar ("startupProbe forbidden without restartPolicy=Always"). The platform already ships the fixed webhook (`linstor-scheduler` re-vendored to upstream chart 0.3.1 / extender v0.3.6, which stopped stripping unknown pod fields), so no action is needed on an up-to-date platform; just do not hold the `linstor-scheduler` package back on an older version when rolling out the plugin.
>
> The same `useSystemBucket` opt-in applies to ClickHouse — see [ClickHouse: opt-in to the system bucket](#clickhouse-opt-in-to-the-system-bucket). When `useSystemBucket: true` is set on ClickHouse, the legacy `<release>-backup` CronJob, credential Secret, and backup script are no longer rendered (they are mutually exclusive with the platform flow); migrate scheduled backups to a `backups.cozystack.io/Plan` against `cozy-default`.

## Tenant workflow

Tenants only ever see the BackupClass name. Typical apply:

```yaml

## Point-in-time recovery (PostgreSQL)

A `RestoreJob` restores a `Postgres` application from a `Backup`. Omit `spec.options.recoveryTime` to recover to the latest point in the WAL archive; set it (RFC3339) to recover the database to an exact instant — a point-in-time recovery (PITR). Under the hood the CNPG barman-cloud plugin restores the newest base backup taken at/before that instant and replays archived WAL up to it, so the restored cluster reflects the database exactly as of `recoveryTime`; later writes are absent.

```yaml
apiVersion: backups.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: RestoreJob
metadata:
  name: orders-db-pitr
  namespace: tenant-acme
spec:
  backupRef:
    name: orders-db-adhoc            # a completed Backup of the source
  targetApplicationRef:              # omit for a destructive in-place restore
    apiGroup: apps.cozystack.io
    kind: Postgres
    name: orders-db-copy             # a pre-deployed, empty Postgres app
  options:
    recoveryTime: "2026-07-21T09:30:00Z"
```

A full, scripted example (write a marker, capture the timestamp, restore to it, assert what survived) is in [`examples/backups/postgres/`](../../examples/backups/postgres/) — `45-restorejob-pitr.yaml`, driven by `run-all.sh`.

### The recoverable window

`recoveryTime` must fall inside the window the archive can reconstruct:

- **Earliest** — the completion of the oldest base backup still in the archive. You cannot recover to an instant before the first base backup: WAL replay always starts from a base backup, and retention (`barmanObjectStore.retentionPolicy`) eventually trims the oldest ones together with the WAL that predates them.
- **Latest** — the timestamp of the most recent WAL segment shipped to object storage. While the source runs with `backup.enabled: true` it archives continuously, so the latest restorable time trails "now" only by the archive lag (seconds for a healthy cluster). Once the source is deleted, the latest restorable time is frozen at whatever WAL made it to S3 before it went away.

A `recoveryTime` **past the latest archived WAL cannot converge**: PostgreSQL replays every available WAL, never reaches the target, exits with `FATAL: recovery ended before configured recovery target was reached`, and CNPG re-creates the recovery instance in a loop. Such a wedged restore is failed by the restore deadline (`spec.options.restoreTimeoutSeconds`, default 30m) — and the driver reads the recovery pod's log at that point, so instead of a generic timeout the RestoreJob ends `status.phase: Failed` with conditions `RecoveryConverged=False` and `Ready=False`, both reason `RecoveryTargetUnreachable`, and a message naming the target. The driver deliberately does **not** fail earlier off that FATAL: a *reachable* near-now target hits the identical FATAL transiently — often repeatedly, on a slow archiver — before it converges, so an earlier trip would reject a recoverable restore. To reject an unreachable target quickly, set a short `restoreTimeoutSeconds`; otherwise widen the window (take a fresh backup, or restore closer to now) or pick a time inside it.

Restoring to a **very recent** instant is safe as long as WAL archiving is current: the segment covering the target may not be in object storage yet and the same FATAL fires transiently, but because the driver only fails at the deadline (not on that FATAL), the recovery has the whole window to catch up — the next attempt promotes once the WAL ships and the cluster goes healthy, which completes the restore. Only a target that never becomes reachable within the deadline is failed. If archiving is badly behind (a stalled `archive_command`, an overloaded cluster) a near-now target can exceed even the default 30m window; restore to a point you can confirm is archived (e.g. at/before the most recent completed backup, per the discovery query below).

A `recoveryTime` **before the earliest base backup** fails differently: PostgreSQL cannot begin replay before the base backup it restored, so recovery never reaches a consistent state and never emits the "recovery ended before …" FATAL the driver classifies on. That case also surfaces at the deadline, but with the generic reason `RestoreFailed` rather than `RecoveryTargetUnreachable`. Choosing a `recoveryTime` at/after the oldest base backup's completion (below) avoids it.

### Discovering the earliest / latest restorable time

CNPG's `Cluster.status.firstRecoverabilityPoint` exists in the status schema but is unreliable under the barman-cloud plugin — it was observed empty on every plugin-backed cluster on the dev7 test cluster (CNPG 1.28.1) — so read the window from the backup catalog instead. Each completed base backup records its WAL range and timestamps on the underlying `cnpg.io/Backup`:

```bash
# Completed base backups, oldest first: STOP is the earliest instant that
# backup alone can restore to; the oldest STOP is the window's lower bound.
kubectl -n <ns> get backups.postgresql.cnpg.io \
  --sort-by=.status.stoppedAt \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PHASE:.status.phase,START:.status.startedAt,STOP:.status.stoppedAt,BEGINWAL:.status.beginWal,ENDWAL:.status.endWal

# The cozystack Backup points at its underlying cnpg.io/Backup and S3 prefix.
kubectl -n <ns> get backup.backups.cozystack.io <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.driverMetadata}'
```

The upper bound — the latest archived WAL — is whatever the source has shipped so far; with archiving healthy, any time up to a few seconds ago is safe. To confirm the archive is current, check that the source cluster's WAL is flowing to S3 (the `barman-cloud` sidecar logs an upload per segment) before restoring to a near-now target.

### Idempotency under GitOps

An in-progress restore is safe to reconcile. The driver purges the target `Cluster` + PVCs exactly once per RestoreJob (guarded by the `TargetPurged` condition and a freshly-recovered check), suspends the target's HelmRelease across the purge so Flux cannot race the bootstrap swap, and resumes it once the recovery cluster is rendered. A Flux reconcile (or a controller restart) mid-restore therefore re-attaches to the recovering cluster rather than deleting it and starting over.
