# OIDC for tenant Kubernetes clusters (Phase 1)

Cozystack tenant Kubernetes clusters opt in to OIDC authentication on their
kube-apiserver through a flat selector on the `Kubernetes` CR. This document
covers the operator-facing surface: what the modes mean, what the chart
provisions on either end, and how to give a user kubectl access.

The architectural rationale lives in
[cozystack/community#24](https://github.com/cozystack/community/pull/24) —
in particular why per-tenant Keycloak realms are deliberately deferred to
Phase 2.

## Selector

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kubernetes
metadata:
  name: prod
  namespace: tenant-acme
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: System        # System | CustomConfig | None (default)
    users:
      - email: alice@acme.example
        role: admin     # admin → cluster-admin
      - email: bob@acme.example
        role: view      # view → view
```

Three modes:

- **None** — the only user-facing path is the static
  `<release>-admin-kubeconfig` Secret (the Kamaji-minted `super-admin.svc`
  kubeconfig). This is the default; existing clusters render byte-identical
  to before.
- **System** — the apiserver trusts the platform Keycloak realm (`cozy` by default, set via `authentication.oidc.realmName`) via a per-cluster public client. Authenticates the users already in that realm (the one cozystack provisions). Zero-config default.
- **CustomConfig** — the apiserver trusts a tenant-supplied OIDC issuer
  directly. `cozy` is not in the path. Use for BYO IdPs (Okta, Auth0, a
  customer's own Keycloak).

The `users[]` map is independent of the mode and drives per-user
`ClusterRoleBinding`s inside the tenant cluster.

## System mode

What the chart provisions, in the management cluster:

1. **KeycloakClient** named `<namespace>-<release>` in the `cozy` realm —
   `public: true`, PKCE required, redirect URIs locked to `localhost:8000`
   and `localhost:18000` (the kubelogin / `kubectl oidc-login` defaults).
2. **KeycloakClientScope** named `<namespace>-<release>-audience` carrying
   an `oidc-audience-mapper` that pins `id_token.aud` to the per-cluster
   clientId. This is the per-cluster isolation primitive: a token minted
   for cluster A is rejected by cluster B's apiserver.
3. A **Secret** `<release>-oidc-authn-config` carrying a structured
   `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` `AuthenticationConfiguration` with
   the cozy realm issuer and the per-cluster audience.
4. A `--authentication-config=` flag, mount, and volume on the
   `KamajiControlPlane` referencing the Secret above.
5. A **bootstrap Job** (Helm `post-install,post-upgrade` hook) that
   applies one `ClusterRoleBinding` per `users[]` entry inside the
   tenant cluster and writes a ready-to-use OIDC kubeconfig Secret on
   the management side (see below).
6. A `<release>-oidc-kubeconfig` Secret in the tenant namespace carrying
   a kubeconfig with a `kubectl oidc-login` exec block, exposed to the
   dashboard via `packages/system/kubernetes-rd`.

The structured authentication-config form (rather than the legacy
`--oidc-*` flags) is intentional: it accepts multiple issuers in a list,
inline private-CA PEM, and future Phase-2 issuers extend the same Secret
instead of fighting the chart shape.

## CustomConfig mode

The tenant supplies the entire `AuthenticationConfiguration`. Two paths:

```yaml
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: CustomConfig
    customConfig:
      config: |
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: AuthenticationConfiguration
        jwt:
        - issuer:
            url: https://idp.acme.example
            certificateAuthority: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            audiences:
            - cozystack-prod
          claimMappings:
            username:
              claim: email
              prefix: ""
            groups:
              claim: groups
              prefix: ""
    users:
      - email: alice@acme.example
        role: admin
```

…or via an out-of-band Secret the operator has already created in the
tenant namespace:

```yaml
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: CustomConfig
    customConfig:
      secretRef:
        name: acme-byo-authn-config       # has key config.yaml
```

`config` and `secretRef.name` are mutually exclusive; the chart fails the
render if both — or neither — are set.

No Keycloak objects land in `cozy`; the chart writes only the
AuthenticationConfiguration Secret (or mounts the operator's) and the
RBAC Job. The `<release>-oidc-kubeconfig` helper Secret is NOT written
in CustomConfig mode: the issuer and clientId are inside the
operator-supplied config and are not knowable to the chart. Distribute
the OIDC kubeconfig out-of-band.

## Aggregated API servers

Authenticating a user is only half of the path. A call that lands on an aggregated API server — an `APIService` backed by an extension server rather than by the core apiserver — reaches it over the aggregation layer, which forwards the caller's identity in request headers. The UID travels in `X-Remote-Uid`, which the aggregation layer sends whenever the `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` gate is on, and the extension server trusts that header only when the tenant kube-apiserver has published it under `requestheader-uid-headers` in the `extension-apiserver-authentication` ConfigMap. Without that key the extension server ignores the header, and the call is served as if the caller had no UID, even though `kubectl` against the core apiserver works fine. Anything on the far side that reads the UID, an authorizer or an audit record, sees an empty value.

Carrying the UID across that hop is a property of the aggregation layer, not of OIDC: a caller authenticated by any means loses their UID the same way. The chart nonetheless renders these flags only when `spec.oidc.mode` is not `None`, which keeps the blast radius to clusters opting into a new feature. A cluster that has never left `mode: None` therefore still loses the UID at the extension server.

Be clear about who this helps. The flag forwards a UID the caller already has; it does not create one. ServiceAccount tokens carry a UID, and so do other identities that set one, and for those the aggregation hop starts working. **OIDC users authenticated through `spec.oidc.mode: System` do not get a UID from this change**, because the AuthenticationConfiguration the chart generates maps `username` and `groups` only. With no `claimMappings.uid` and no CEL expression for it, upstream returns an empty UID (`plugin/pkg/authenticator/token/oidc/oidc.go`, `getUID`, read at v0.35.0), so there is nothing for the header to carry. Giving those users a UID means mapping a claim, which changes the identity of users who currently have none, and is tracked separately rather than done here. In `CustomConfig` mode an operator-supplied configuration that maps `uid` does produce one, and then this change carries it.

Whenever `spec.oidc.mode` is not `None`, the chart renders the flags that publish it, alongside `--authentication-config`:

| `spec.version` | rendered |
| --- | --- |
| `v1.31` | nothing — the flag does not exist upstream, and an unknown flag stops the apiserver from starting |
| `v1.32` | `--requestheader-uid-headers=X-Remote-Uid` plus `--feature-gates=RemoteRequestHeaderUID=true` |
| `v1.33` and newer | `--requestheader-uid-headers=X-Remote-Uid` |

The gate is rendered on `v1.32` only, where `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` is still alpha and the apiserver rejects the flag while the gate is off. From `v1.33` the gate is beta and on by default, so rendering it would buy nothing and would collide with a gate list of your own.

The version in that table is the effective one, not the image tag. `--emulated-version` in `controlPlane.apiServer.extraArgs` moves it: the gate resolves through the versioned spec at the emulated version, so `--emulated-version=1.32` puts `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` back to alpha-and-off on a `v1.35` cluster, and the chart follows by rendering the gate alongside the header flag. Below `1.32` the gate has no spec at all, `featureGate.Set()` reports it PreAlpha and refuses to enable it, so the chart renders neither flag.

Two values the chart ignores are still not harmless. An element naming another component, `--emulated-version=wardle=1.2`, says nothing about the tenant kube-apiserver, but the apiserver rejects a component it has not registered, `component not registered: wardle`, and does not start. A value whose minor is above your `spec.version` is ignored too, because emulation only moves the effective version down, and there the apiserver checks against a range rather than a ceiling: it rejects one above its own binary or below the floor it still supports, naming the range it accepts. In both cases the control plane will not start whatever the chart renders.

Adding either flag through `controlPlane.apiServer.extraArgs` by hand is no longer necessary, and an existing cluster that does keeps working: the chart skips its own copy when your entry already carries `X-Remote-Uid` or already enables the gate.

Where your entry does not already satisfy the requirement, the chart works around it rather than failing. On `v1.32` a `--feature-gates` entry of yours that says nothing about `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` gets a second entry rendered after it, carrying your terms plus `RemoteRequestHeaderUID=true`. That decides the gate whether the tenant control plane collapses duplicate flags into the last one or hands both to the apiserver, which merges them in the order it reads them; carrying your terms into the merged entry is what makes the first reading safe.

If you turned the gate off on purpose, with `RemoteRequestHeaderUID=false` or a blanket `AllAlpha=false` on `v1.32` and `AllBeta=false` from `v1.33`, the chart renders neither flag and the render is byte-identical to the one before this feature existed. You keep losing the UID at the aggregation layer, which is what the opt-out asks for. On a cluster that is already running, adding the opt-out and removing it again each need one more edit alongside, below.

The running control plane is a separate matter, and on `v1.33` and newer this needs care. The tenant control plane rewrites the apiserver's arguments from scratch only when the *number* of `extraArgs` entries changes. Otherwise it starts from the arguments already on the running Deployment and lays the new list over them, so a flag that has left `extraArgs` stays behind. That is behaviour of the Kamaji build this repo pins in `packages/system/kamaji` rather than a property of Kubernetes, and upstream has since changed it. It bites in both directions:

- Adding the opt-out adds one entry while the chart drops one, so the count does not change, and the `--requestheader-uid-headers=X-Remote-Uid` already on the running Deployment stays there beside your now-disabled gate.
- Removing the opt-out entry to turn the feature back on drops one entry while the chart adds one. The count again does not change, so your `RemoteRequestHeaderUID=false` or `AllBeta=false` stays on the Deployment beside the header flag the chart now renders, although your CR no longer shows it.
- `--emulated-version=1.31` has the same shape both ways on `v1.33` and `v1.34`. Adding it leaves the header flag behind at an emulated version where the gate is off; removing it leaves the emulation behind beside the header flag the chart now renders. From `v1.35` that value is below the oldest version the apiserver can emulate, and it refuses to start on it in any case.

The apiserver refuses to start in each of these combinations.

Change the entry count in the same edit to force the rewrite, whichever way you are going: any second flag you were going to add or drop anyway will do, or set `spec.oidc.mode: None`, let it converge, and turn it back on. On `v1.32` the count changes by itself as long as the chart renders the gate too, because it then drops or adds two entries rather than one; where the gate is already yours, the chart renders the header flag alone and the rule above applies as it does on `v1.33`. That migration is the whole mitigation, and it stays necessary for as long as the pinned build keys the rewrite on the entry count; the fix belongs to that pin rather than to this chart, and is tracked in cozystack/cozystack#3541. The paths that need no operator edit are clear: turning the feature on for a default tenant moves the count, and a tenant already carrying the opt-out renders byte-identically before and after.

The render still fails where a uid-headers list of your own describes a kube-apiserver that already refuses to start: a list that omits `X-Remote-Uid`, a list with an element that is empty once trimmed, which a trailing comma leaves behind, and a list alongside a gate setting that turns `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` off. The chart cannot rescue any of them by withholding its own flag, because the flag the apiserver rejects is yours. The error message names the fix, which beats a crash-looping control plane.

Outside those shapes, nothing that renders today stops rendering: these flags are new, so every other `extraArgs` shape reaching this code was rendering before it existed. Setups whose gate is genuinely already on are left alone, whether you named it explicitly or switched it on with a blanket `AllAlpha=true`.

The gate check reads your entry the way the apiserver does.

- An element may name a component, because `--feature-gates` is a colon-separated multimap: `kube:RemoteRequestHeaderUID=false` is the same opinion as `RemoteRequestHeaderUID=false`, while an element naming another component is not about the tenant kube-apiserver and is ignored, on the same terms as an unregistered component in `--emulated-version` above.
- The chart writes its own term in whichever spelling you used, because the apiserver rejects a value mixing the bare and `kube:` forms.
- Past that it is one `Name=value` element at a time, spaces trimmed on both sides, and the value resolved the way `strconv.ParseBool` resolves it, so `1`, `t` and `T` mean the same as `true`, and `0`, `f` and `F` the same as `false`.
- Blanket settings count, because the apiserver applies them to every gate you have not named explicitly. On `v1.32` a `--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true` genuinely switches `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` on, so the chart treats it as yours and leaves it alone; from `v1.33` the mirror image applies, and `AllBeta=false` reads as your opt-out.
- Naming the gate wins either way: `AllAlpha=true,RemoteRequestHeaderUID=false` is an opt-out on `v1.32`, and `AllBeta=false,RemoteRequestHeaderUID=true` leaves the gate on from `v1.33`, because an explicit entry beats a blanket one whichever order they appear in.
- Gate names are compared exactly, as the apiserver looks them up, so `remoterequestheaderuid=true` is not an opinion about `RemoteRequestHeaderUID`; the apiserver would reject that spelling as an unrecognized gate anyway.
- An entry with an empty value is not an entry as far as the chart is concerned: it reads the last entry that carries a value.

Do not rely on an empty value to cancel an earlier entry, and this has nothing to do with OIDC: the tenant control plane collapses `extraArgs` by flag name, again a property of the pinned build rather than of Kubernetes, and writes an empty value back as a bare flag, so a trailing `--requestheader-uid-headers=` reaches the apiserver as `--requestheader-uid-headers`, which it refuses to start on. Drop the entry you do not want instead of emptying it.

Quotes stop the chart from reading your entry at all. `--requestheader-uid-headers` and `--emulated-version` are both CSV-parsed by the apiserver, which strips a surrounding pair of double quotes before it sees the value, and the chart does not reproduce that. Rather than act on a value it may be reading differently, it renders neither flag, exactly as it did before these flags existed. That applies to the entry the chart reads, the last one on that flag that carries a value; quotes on an earlier entry that a later one replaces change nothing. Drop the quotes if you want the chart to read the entry.

The uid-headers list is read without trimming, because the apiserver does not trim it either: `--requestheader-uid-headers=X-Remote-Uid , Other` does not contain `X-Remote-Uid` as far as the apiserver is concerned, and the chart treats it the same way rather than accepting a value the apiserver will reject. The emptiness check is the one that trims, again because the apiserver's does: in `X-Remote-Uid, ` the second element is empty once trimmed, and the apiserver refuses the whole list with `empty value in "requestheader-uid-headers"` although `X-Remote-Uid` is in it.

On `v1.31` the chart renders neither flag, and the UID guards above do not run, so a uid-headers or `--feature-gates` entry of yours passes through untouched. The unrelated `--oidc-*` and `--authentication-config` collision guards still apply there as everywhere else. Aggregated API servers cannot see the caller's UID on `v1.31`; move the cluster to `v1.32` or newer if you need them to. Writing `--requestheader-uid-headers` yourself does not work around it — the flag does not exist on `v1.31`, and an unknown flag stops the apiserver from starting.

## Users and RBAC

`users[]` is a flat list. Each entry produces a single
`ClusterRoleBinding` inside the tenant cluster, labelled
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=cozystack-oidc` and
`app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release>`. The CRB name is a
deterministic hash of `<release>-<email>`, so the same email always
maps to the same binding.

| `role:` | `ClusterRole` bound |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | `cluster-admin` |
| `view` | `view` |

The CRB `User:` subject is the literal `email` value; it must match the
`email` claim emitted by the issuer. The chart-generated OIDC
kubeconfig requests `--oidc-extra-scope=email` in the
`kubectl oidc-login` exec block, so the token includes `email`
regardless of whether the per-cluster client lists `email` in its
default client scopes. The `email` scope itself is a built-in OIDC
scope available in every conformant issuer (Keycloak included), so no
extra realm-side configuration is required for `System`. For
`CustomConfig`, verify your BYO issuer emits the `email` claim when
the client requests the `email` scope; every conformant OIDC provider
does.

Toggling a user out of `users[]` revokes their access on the next chart
reconcile — the bootstrap Job prunes any CRBs labelled by the release
that are no longer in the desired list.

The static admin kubeconfig stays as the documented break-glass path
regardless of mode.

## How a user logs in (System mode)

The user installs `kubectl oidc-login` once:

```bash
kubectl krew install oidc-login
```

The operator hands them the OIDC kubeconfig. The Secret name follows
the Helm release pattern `kubernetes-<cluster>-oidc-kubeconfig` (the
cozystack-api prefixes the cluster name with `kubernetes-` when it
materialises the `HelmRelease`):

```bash
kubectl --namespace tenant-acme get secret kubernetes-prod-oidc-kubeconfig \
  --output=jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d > prod.kubeconfig
```

First `kubectl --kubeconfig prod.kubeconfig get …` call triggers the
Keycloak browser flow on localhost:8000 (then 18000 as fallback) and
caches the token locally. Subsequent calls are silent until the token
expires.

## Failure modes

- **`mode: System` without the platform-level OIDC feature** — chart
  render hard-fails: `spec.oidc.mode: System requires the platform-level
  OIDC feature (authentication.oidc.enabled) — enable it in
  cozystack-values, or use mode: CustomConfig for a tenant-supplied
  issuer.`
- **`CustomConfig` with an unreachable issuer or wrong claim mappings** —
  the apiserver rejects tokens at request time; the admin kubeconfig
  keeps working as break-glass.
- **`emailVerified` on Keycloak users is a prescriptive requirement,
  not a chart-enforced one.** The chart emits a
  `claimValidationRules` entry keyed on `groups` (see next bullet),
  but not one keyed on `email_verified`. The layered guarantees you
  rely on instead:
  1. Provision users with `emailVerified: true` (via `KeycloakRealmUser`
     or the Keycloak UI's email-verify flow) so no unverified identity
     ever holds the email you name in `users[].email`.
  2. The `cozy` realm keeps Keycloak's default `duplicateEmails: false`,
     so a second account cannot claim an already-registered address to
     impersonate an existing operator.
  3. As a k8s side-effect, if the issuer explicitly emits
     `email_verified: false` on a token the apiserver rejects it with
     `oidc: email not verified` — but a *missing* claim is treated as
     verified.
  Adding a CEL `claimValidationRules` entry
  (`!has(claims.email_verified) || claims.email_verified == true`) to
  the rendered System-mode config would elevate item 3 to a hard gate;
  that is a reasonable follow-up hardening but is out of scope for
  Phase 1.

- **Cross-tenant isolation gate.** The rendered
  `AuthenticationConfiguration` carries a CEL `claimValidationRules`
  entry on the `groups` claim that rejects any token whose caller is
  not a member of at least one of this tenant's four Keycloak groups:

  ```
  <namespace>-view <namespace>-use <namespace>-admin <namespace>-super-admin
  ```

  The tenant chart (`packages/apps/tenant/templates/keycloakgroups.yaml`)
  provisions these groups in the shared `cozy` realm. Without this
  gate, any authenticated cozy-realm user could point `kubectl
  oidc-login` at another tenant's cluster, land at
  `system:authenticated`, and enumerate the discovery surface
  (`kubectl api-resources`, OpenAPI schemata) — RBAC would default-deny
  named-resource access, but discovery still leaks. Symmetric with the
  Grafana-side `allowed_groups` gate on the Monitoring chart's
  `auth.generic_oauth` block (see `docs/oidc-grafana.md`). CustomConfig
  mode does NOT get this gate injected — the tenant's own
  AuthenticationConfiguration is authoritative and the tenant is
  responsible for their own claim-side guards.
- **`kubectl` without the `oidc-login` plugin** — the exec block errors
  out client-side; install the plugin.

## What is NOT in Phase 1

- **Per-tenant Keycloak realms.** Phase 2 candidate; tracked in
  cozystack/community#24 (Option B — retained as the strongest isolation
  answer; Option A is Keycloak Organizations).
- **Federating an external IdP into `cozy`.** Out of scope.
- **Cross-cluster SSO inside one tenant.** Each cluster has its own
  audience — that is the per-cluster isolation primitive.
- **Custom credential plugin / RFC 8693 token exchange.** Possible future
  optimisation; not required for the per-cluster client + audience model.
