# OIDC for the Grafana instance (Phase 1)

Cozystack ships one Grafana codebase deployed twice: as
`monitoring-system` in the platform's `cozy-monitoring` namespace and as
`monitoring` in every tenant namespace. Both instances opt in to OIDC
authentication through the same flat selector on the `Monitoring` CR.
This document covers the operator-facing surface: what the modes mean,
what the chart provisions, and how a user signs in.

The architectural rationale lives in
[cozystack/community#24](https://github.com/cozystack/community/pull/24)
— in particular why per-tenant Keycloak realms are deliberately
deferred to Phase 2. This Grafana integration follows the same shape
as the tenant kube-apiserver's Phase 1
([cozystack/cozystack#3044](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pull/3044)),
adapted for a server-side (confidential) OAuth client instead of a
public kubectl one: authentication is wired up by the chart, but
authorization is an operator-supplied `users:` map reconciled into
the target (Grafana orgs here, ClusterRoleBindings in #3044) by a
chart-owned Job. The chart does not own any directory objects.

## Selector

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Monitoring
metadata:
  name: monitoring
  namespace: tenant-acme
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: System        # System | CustomConfig | None (default)
    users:
      - email: alice@acme.example
        role: Admin
      - email: bob@acme.example
        role: Viewer
```

Three modes:

- **None** — the only user-facing path is the `grafana-admin-password`
  Secret, exposed to the tenant through
  `packages/system/monitoring-rd`. This is the default; existing
  instances render byte-identical to before.
- **System** — the Grafana instance trusts the platform `cozy` Keycloak
  realm via a per-instance confidential client. Users are the ones a
  platform admin already provisioned in `cozy`; the tenant does not
  manage a directory of its own.
- **CustomConfig** — Grafana trusts a tenant-supplied OIDC issuer
  directly. `cozy` is not in the path. Use for BYO IdPs (Okta, Auth0,
  a customer's own Keycloak).

The `grafana-admin-password` Secret stays a documented break-glass
path in every mode; `disable_login_form` is not flipped by this
selector. Hardening that further (e.g. locking the form off in
`System` mode) is a follow-up.

## System mode

What the chart provisions, in the release namespace of the Monitoring
CR:

1. **KeycloakClient** named `<namespace>-<release>` in the `cozy`
   realm — `public: false`, `directAccess: false`. The `secret` field
   points at a chart-owned Kubernetes Secret via the EDP-Keycloak
   `$<secret>:<key>` syntax so the operator provisions the same
   confidential secret to Keycloak that Grafana reads at runtime.
   `redirectUris` is locked to
   `https://grafana.<host>/login/generic_oauth`.
2. **KeycloakClientScope** named `<namespace>-<release>-audience`
   carrying an `oidc-audience-mapper` that pins `id_token.aud` to the
   per-instance clientId. This is the per-instance isolation
   primitive: a token minted for one Monitoring release is rejected
   by another's Grafana.
3. A **Secret** `<release>-oidc-client` carrying a random 32-char
   `client-secret`. Generated on first install (`lookup` + random
   fallback, same pattern as `packages/system/dashboard`), preserved
   across upgrades.
4. The Grafana CR's `spec.config.auth.generic_oauth` section wired to
   the platform realm issuer (`cozy` by default, `authentication.oidc.realmName`) + the per-instance audience scope. Two
   independent gates ride on top of the raw OAuth wiring:

   **Tenant-membership gate — unconditional in System mode.** The chart
   requests the `groups` OIDC scope (already provisioned platform-wide
   by `packages/system/keycloak-configure` as a realm-default
   KeycloakClientScope with an `oidc-group-membership-mapper`) and sets

   ```
   allowed_groups = <namespace>-view <namespace>-use <namespace>-admin <namespace>-super-admin
   groups_attribute_path = groups
   ```

   `groups_attribute_path` is REQUIRED alongside `allowed_groups` on
   Grafana v11.x+: without it Grafana leaves the extracted
   `user.Groups` slice empty regardless of what the userinfo endpoint
   returns, and the gate rejects every login with "user not a member
   of one of the required groups" — even when the token carries the
   correct claim (verified end-to-end on dev3 with Grafana v11.6.15).
   The JMESPath expression `groups` reads the top-level `groups`
   array from userinfo, matching the shape Keycloak's
   `oidc-group-membership-mapper` emits.

   The four groups match the KeycloakRealmGroups the tenant chart
   provisions in the `cozy` realm — see
   `packages/apps/tenant/templates/keycloakgroups.yaml`. Grafana
   rejects any login whose token does not carry at least one of these
   groups. This is the isolation primitive that stops tenant-alice
   from signing into tenant-bob's Grafana even though both authenticate
   against the same flat `cozy` realm. The audience mapper in point 2
   protects against *replay* of a minted token across releases; this
   gate protects against *issuance* of a usable token to a caller
   outside the release's tenant.

   **Users-map contract — active only when `spec.oidc.users` is
   non-empty.** Three additional keys are merged on top:
   - `skip_org_role_sync = true` — a login never overwrites the
     users-Job's role assignments;
   - `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup = true` — the OIDC identity
     binds to the pre-provisioned local account by email;
   - `allow_sign_up = false` — a cozy-realm identity whose email is
     NOT in `spec.oidc.users` is rejected at login (even if they are
     a tenant member and pass the group gate) instead of being
     admitted as `auto_assign_org_role` Viewer and waiting for the
     next helm-upgrade prune pass to clean them up.

   When `spec.oidc.users` is empty (or unset) the three users-map
   keys are NOT forced. The tenant-membership gate still applies, so
   only tenant members can log in — they land at Grafana's
   `auto_assign_org_role` default (`Viewer`). This is the intended
   hands-off contract: the chart owns nothing app-side, but the
   Keycloak-layer gate still isolates the release. Cross-tenant
   users are rejected outright; in-tenant users get a self-service
   Viewer with no org-role management by the chart.
5. A `GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` env on the Grafana
   Deployment sourced from the Secret in step 3.
6. A post-install/post-upgrade **users-Job** — see the "Users and
   RBAC" section — that reconciles `spec.oidc.users` into Grafana's
   Main Org.

No `KeycloakRealmGroup`s and no `role_attribute_path`. Directory
objects (users, groups, group memberships) stay owned by whoever
operates the `cozy` realm; the Monitoring release only requests
authentication wiring, it does not act as a user directory.

Server-level `GrafanaAdmin` promotion (`allow_assign_grafana_admin`)
is out of scope for Phase 1. All Grafana instances — platform and
tenant — cap at org-level `Admin`.

## CustomConfig mode

The tenant supplies the entire `[auth.generic_oauth]` payload. Two
paths:

```yaml
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: CustomConfig
    customConfig:
      config:
        client_id: my-grafana
        client_secret: xxxxxxxx
        auth_url: https://idp.acme.example/protocol/openid-connect/auth
        token_url: https://idp.acme.example/protocol/openid-connect/token
        api_url: https://idp.acme.example/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
        scopes: openid email profile
```

…or via an existing Secret in the tenant namespace whose `auth.ini`
key holds a ready-made `[auth.generic_oauth]` fragment:

```yaml
spec:
  oidc:
    mode: CustomConfig
    customConfig:
      secretRef:
        name: acme-byo-grafana-auth
```

When `spec.oidc.users` is non-empty the chart merges three settings
on top of the operator's inline map so the users-Job contract holds
in `CustomConfig` mode too:

- `skip_org_role_sync = true` — a login never overwrites the Job's
  org-role assignments;
- `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup = true` — the OIDC identity
  binds to the pre-provisioned local account by email;
- `allow_sign_up = false` — an OIDC identity whose email is not in
  the users-map is rejected at login instead of being admitted with
  the default `auto_assign_org_role`.

All three keys are chart-forced (`merge` semantics, chart wins) —
setting them in the operator's map is a no-op, and
`role_attribute_path` would just be dead config since the Job
manages roles.

When `spec.oidc.users` is empty (or unset) the chart forces none of
the three keys — a BYO-IdP operator who does not use the users-map
gets their inline `auth.generic_oauth` applied verbatim. This
matters because `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup` against a BYO
issuer that does not verify emails is a needless account-linking
surface, and `allow_sign_up = false` with no pre-provisioned
accounts would lock everyone out. If you want the isolation
posture without the users-map, set the keys explicitly in your
inline map.

**`secretRef.name` mode disables the users-map.** The chart mounts the
operator's `auth.ini` fragment verbatim via `GF_PATHS_CUSTOM_INI` and
cannot inject either of the two chart-forced settings. Setting
`spec.oidc.users` alongside `customConfig.secretRef.name` fails the
render with an explicit message — the alternatives are: (a) use
`customConfig.config` (inline) and let the chart merge, or (b) leave
`spec.oidc.users` empty and include both `skip_org_role_sync = true`
and `oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup = true` in your ini fragment
plus manage the OIDC → Grafana user mapping yourself.

Setting both `config` and `secretRef.name` (or neither) fails the
render. In `CustomConfig` mode no Keycloak objects are provisioned in
`cozy` and no chart-owned client-secret Secret is created — the
operator manages their own credentials end-to-end.

## Users and RBAC

Grafana's built-in identity model exposes three org-level roles:
`Admin` / `Editor` / `Viewer`. The chart drives them from an
operator-supplied map on the CR:

```yaml
spec:
  oidc:
    users:
      - email: alice@acme.example
        role: Admin
      - email: bob@acme.example
        role: Editor
      - email: carol@acme.example
        role: Viewer
```

A chart-owned Job runs on every `helm install` / `helm upgrade` and
reconciles that list into Main Org. membership via Grafana's admin
API:

1. Each listed email gets a pre-provisioned local Grafana account
   with a random password. The account is a shell; the operator
   never uses that password. When they sign in with the OIDC flow
   Grafana looks up the pre-provisioned account by email
   (`oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup = true`) and attaches the
   OIDC identity to it.
2. Each listed email is added to Main Org. with the requested role.
   Re-runs of the Job converge role changes (`Editor` → `Admin`,
   demotions, etc.) via `PATCH /api/orgs/{orgId}/users/{userId}`.
3. Every Main-Org member whose email is neither in the list nor the
   break-glass `grafana-admin-password` login is removed. Removing
   an entry from `users:` and re-reconciling revokes access.

The Job renders only when **both** `mode != None` and
`spec.oidc.users` is non-empty. Three empty-users states all resolve
to the same hands-off contract — the chart owns nothing in Grafana
orgs:

- `mode: None` — OIDC is off, no chart-managed org membership at
  all. This matters on upgrade: existing tenants who ran the
  pre-PR Monitoring chart may have added users to Grafana manually
  through the UI; if the Job ran in `mode: None` its prune pass
  would silently delete those accounts on the next Flux reconcile.
- `customConfig.secretRef` — the users-map is forbidden by the
  render-time assert; the operator's mounted `auth.ini` fragment is
  authoritative.
- `mode: System | CustomConfig-inline` with `users:` unset — the
  operator opted into OIDC but not into the chart-managed users-map;
  they manage org membership themselves.

Setting `users: [...]` on the CR means the chart owns Main-Org
membership — anything added by hand (Grafana UI, admin API, other
tooling) gets pruned on the next reconcile. The reverse edge is
worth calling out: taking `users:` back to `[]` (or unsetting it)
does NOT prune the last entry — the chart stops managing membership
and any accounts the Job provisioned are left in place. Operators
who want to clean up OIDC-provisioned accounts after switching
`System | CustomConfig → None` (or after emptying `users:`) do it
themselves through the Grafana UI or admin API. The
`activeDeadlineSeconds` and `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` notes below
only apply when the Job actually renders.

While the users-map is active, users NOT listed in `spec.oidc.users`
who try to log in through OIDC are rejected at the door
(`allow_sign_up = false`) — no account is minted, no default
`Viewer` role is assigned. `skip_org_role_sync = true` in the
Grafana config additionally makes sure the Job's assignments
outlive the next login for users who ARE listed.

For `System` mode, the operator provisions the corresponding
Keycloak user in `cozy` in whatever way they already do (Keycloak
UI, a `KeycloakRealmUser` CR, an identity broker) and adds them to
one of the tenant's `<namespace>-{view,use,admin,super-admin}`
groups — Grafana's `allowed_groups` rejects the login otherwise.
The Monitoring release does not create Keycloak users and does not
provision `KeycloakRealmGroup`s — group directory ownership stays
with the tenant chart (`packages/apps/tenant`); group membership is
curated by whoever operates the `cozy` realm.

## How a user logs in

The user opens `https://grafana.<host>` in a browser and picks the
"Sign in with Keycloak" button under the login form. Grafana runs the
Authorization Code + PKCE flow against the cozy realm, receives a
token whose `aud` claim matches this Monitoring instance's clientId,
and — if the user's email is in `spec.oidc.users` — binds the OIDC
identity to the pre-provisioned local account with the role the Job
already set.

If the user's email is not in `spec.oidc.users` (and the users-map
is active — `mode != None` and the list is non-empty) the login is
refused by Grafana at the OAuth callback — `allow_sign_up = false`
does not mint an account for them. Add them to `spec.oidc.users`
and re-apply the CR; the Job will run on the next helm-upgrade,
pre-provision their local account, and the next login attempt will
succeed. When the users-map is inactive Grafana's default
`allow_sign_up = true` applies and any authenticated cozy-realm
identity lands with `auto_assign_org_role` (Viewer).

The break-glass `admin_user` / `admin_password` field on the form
stays wired to the `grafana-admin-password` Secret and continues to
work — useful when Keycloak is down or misconfigured.

## Failure modes

- **`mode: System` without the platform-level OIDC feature** — chart
  render hard-fails:
  `spec.oidc.mode: System requires the platform-level OIDC feature`.
  Flip `authentication.oidc.enabled: true` in the platform values, or
  switch to `CustomConfig`. On the platform side that flag also
  swings the `cozystack.monitoring-application` PackageSource from
  variant `default` (baseline dependsOn only) to variant `oidc`
  (additionally waits for `cozystack.keycloak-operator` so the
  `v1.edp.epam.com` CRDs consumed by the Keycloak-side of System
  mode are registered before the monitoring chart reconciles).
- **`mode: System` without the Keycloak operator CRDs registered** —
  chart render hard-fails:
  `spec.oidc.mode: System requires the Keycloak operator CRDs
  (v1.edp.epam.com/v1)`. Symmetric across
  `templates/grafana/oidc-keycloak.yaml` and
  `templates/grafana/grafana.yaml` so Grafana never comes up with an
  `auth.generic_oauth` block pointing at a client that never gets
  provisioned. For the platform `monitoring-system` release the
  `oidc` variant's `dependsOn: cozystack.keycloak-operator` prevents
  the race; for tenant releases (`Monitoring` CR with
  `mode: System`) verify the keycloak-operator package is deployed
  before creating the CR.
- **`CustomConfig` with an unreachable issuer or wrong claim
  mappings** — Grafana rejects the callback and the login screen
  shows an error; the `admin_user`/`admin_password` Secret keeps
  working as break-glass.
- **User successfully logs in but sees no dashboards.** Their email
  is missing from `spec.oidc.users` — no org role was assigned.
  Add the entry and re-apply the CR; the users-Job runs on the
  next helm-upgrade and grants access.
- **users-Job fails.** The Job caps at `activeDeadlineSeconds: 900`
  and `backoffLimit: 6`. Common causes: Grafana never becomes
  ready (check `kubectl -n <ns> get pods -l app=grafana`), or the
  `grafana-admin-password` Secret is missing its `user`/`password`
  keys. `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600` keeps the failed hook Job
  (and its Pod's logs) around for **one hour** after the terminal
  Failed condition — check its logs with
  `kubectl -n <ns> logs job/<release>-oidc-users` inside that window.
  After 1h the Kubernetes TTL controller garbage-collects the Job
  and the Pod together, so grab the logs quickly; if you missed
  the window, re-trigger the hook with `helm upgrade` on the
  release and reproduce.
- **`emailVerified` on Keycloak users is a prescriptive requirement,
  not a chart-enforced one.** The chart does not emit any
  `claimValidationRules` — the layered guarantees you rely on
  instead are:
  1. Provision users with `emailVerified: true` (via
     `KeycloakRealmUser` or the Keycloak UI's email-verify flow) so
     no unverified identity ever holds a given email.
  2. The `cozy` realm keeps Keycloak's default
     `duplicateEmails: false`, so a second account cannot claim an
     already-registered address to impersonate an existing operator.
  3. Grafana's own login flow rejects tokens the apiserver rejects,
     so on the wire the same guarantee still holds through the JWT
     signature and audience checks.
  Adding a CEL `claimValidationRules` entry is a reasonable
  follow-up hardening; it is out of scope for Phase 1.
- **`CustomConfig` with both or neither payload set** — chart render
  hard-fails: `set exactly one of 'config' (inline) or
  'secretRef.name' — they are mutually exclusive`, or `CustomConfig
  requires either spec.oidc.customConfig.config … or …secretRef.name`.

## What is NOT in Phase 1

- **Per-tenant Keycloak realms.** Phase 2 candidate; tracked in
  cozystack/community#24.
- **Full-logout through Keycloak's end-session endpoint.**
  `auth.generic_oauth` native to Grafana does the OAuth part; wiring
  `--backend-logout-url` and the corresponding Keycloak client
  attribute is a subsequent hardening.
- **`disable_login_form: true` under `mode: System`.** Kept off so
  the `admin_user`/`admin_password` Secret remains a documented
  break-glass path; hardening it is a follow-up.
- **Server-level `GrafanaAdmin` promotion.** All Grafana instances
  cap at org-level `Admin`. Not exposed on the CR.
- **CEL `claimValidationRules` enforcing `email_verified`.** See the
  failure-modes note above.
- **Multi-issuer / BYO alongside `cozy`.** `mode: System` and
  `mode: CustomConfig` are mutually exclusive on a single Monitoring
  release — no composition. Follow the tenant kube-apiserver PR's
  structured-config path if you need this later.
