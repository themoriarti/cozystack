## Features and Improvements

* **[lineage] Separate webhook from cozy controller**: Separated the lineage-controller-webhook from cozystack-controller into a separate daemonset component deployed on all control-plane nodes, reducing API server latency and improving performance by decreasing outgoing API calls. Introduced internal label to track resources already handled by the webhook ([**@lllamnyp**](https://github.com/lllamnyp) in #1515).

## Fixes

* **[api] Fix listing tenantnamespaces for non-oidc users**: Fixed TenantNamespace listing functionality for users not using OIDC authentication, ensuring proper namespace visibility for all authentication methods ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1517, #1519).

## Migration and Upgrades

* **[platform] Better migration for 0.36.2->0.37.2+**: Improved migration script for users upgrading directly from 0.36.2 to 0.37.2+, ensuring the new lineage webhook daemonset is properly deployed and fixing a bug where webhook readiness was not appropriately verified during migration ([**@lllamnyp**](https://github.com/lllamnyp) in #1521, #1522).
