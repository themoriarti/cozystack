## Fixes

* [virtual-machine] Enable using custom `instanceType` values in `virtual-machine` and `vm-instance` by disabling field validation. (@lllamnyp in https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pull/1300, backported in https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pull/1303)
* [kubernetes] Disable VPA for VPA in tenant Kubernetes clusters. Tenant clusters have no need for this feature, and it was not designed to work in a tenant cluster, but was enabled by mistake. (@lllamnyp in https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pull/1301, backported in https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pull/1305)
