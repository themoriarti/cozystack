## Fixes

* **[api] Revert dynamic list kinds representation fix (fixes namespace deletion regression)**: Reverted changes from #1630 that caused a regression affecting namespace deletion and upgrades from previous versions. The regression caused namespace deletion failures with errors like "content is not a list: []unstructured.Unstructured" during namespace finalization. This revert restores compatibility with namespace deletion controller and fixes upgrade issues from previous versions, particularly when running migration 20 ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1677).
