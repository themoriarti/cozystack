# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to the [`cozystack/cozystack`](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack) repository and to release artifacts produced from it, including Cozystack core components, operators, packaged manifests, container images, and installation assets published by the project.

Cozystack integrates and ships many upstream cloud native components. If you believe a vulnerability originates in an upstream project rather than in Cozystack-specific code, packaging, defaults, or integration logic, please report it to the upstream project as well. If you are unsure, report it to Cozystack first and we will help route or coordinate the issue.

## Supported Versions

The Cozystack project maintains three release lines at a time: **the latest stable minor and the two minors preceding it.** That is a rolling rule rather than a list of version numbers, so it does not go stale between releases — read it against the GitHub Releases page to see which concrete lines it currently names:

<https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/releases>

Note that the rule is keyed to release lines, not to the existence of a `release-X.Y` branch. Release branches are never deleted, so every line back to the earliest still has one, and branch existence says nothing about whether a line is maintained.

| Version line | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Latest stable minor | Supported | Current stable release line. Security fixes land here first, and patch releases are cut from it. |
| The two minors preceding the latest | Supported | Receive security and important maintenance fixes, backported from the current line. |
| Older `1.x` minors | Limited support | Critical and upgrade-blocking fixes may be backported at maintainer discretion. Adopters are encouraged to move to a supported line. |
| `v0.41.x` | End of life | The final pre-v1 line. It received patch releases through March 2026 during the v0 to v1 transition and no longer does; no further fixes are planned. |
| Everything before `v0.41` | Not supported | Long superseded. Upgrade to a `1.x` line. |
| `alpha`, `beta`, `rc` releases | Not supported | Pre-release builds are for testing and evaluation only. |

Being in a supported row does not mean a line receives every fix. **The project does not have a documented rule for choosing which supported lines a given fix is backported to** — that decision is taken per fix by the maintainers, weighing severity against the risk and effort of the backport. This is stated rather than dressed up as a policy because no such policy exists; adopters who need a specific fix on a specific line should ask.

Reporting a vulnerability against a line with limited support or at end of life is still welcome. We will confirm whether the issue also affects a supported line and fix it there; whether the fix is additionally backported to the older line is a per-fix maintainer decision on the same basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, Telegram, Slack, or other public community channels.

Please report vulnerabilities privately through one of the following channels, in order of preference:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** — the preferred channel. Open the repository's **Security** tab, then **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** (<https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/security/advisories/new>). This creates a confidential advisory visible only to you and the maintainers, and is the CNCF-recommended path for coordinated disclosure.
2. **Contact a maintainer** listed in [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md) through an existing private channel you already have. Reports are triaged by the maintainers responsible for security response — [@kvaps](https://github.com/kvaps), [@lexfrei](https://github.com/lexfrei), [@tym83](https://github.com/tym83), [@matthieu-robin](https://github.com/matthieu-robin) and [@mattia-eleuteri](https://github.com/mattia-eleuteri) — but any maintainer can receive a report and route it.
3. If you have neither, use a public community channel only to request a private contact path, without disclosing any vulnerability details.

Please do not include exploit details, credentials, tokens, private keys, customer data, or other sensitive material in any public message.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the following as possible:

- affected Cozystack version, tag, or commit
- affected component or package, for example operator, API server, dashboard, installer, or a packaged system component
- deployment environment and provider, for example bare metal, Hetzner, Oracle Cloud, or other infrastructure
- prerequisites and exact reproduction steps
- impact, attack scenario, and expected blast radius
- whether authentication, tenant access, cluster-admin access, or network adjacency is required
- known mitigations or workarounds
- whether you believe the issue also affects an upstream dependency

## What to Expect

The maintainers will aim to:

- acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- perform an initial triage and severity assessment within 7 business days
- keep the reporter informed as the fix and disclosure plan are developed

Resolution timelines depend on severity, complexity, release branch applicability, and whether coordination with upstream projects is required.

### Disclosure timeline

The project follows a coordinated-disclosure window of **up to 90 days** from acknowledgement. If a fix or mitigation is not available within that window, the maintainers may publish the advisory (via GitHub Security Advisories) with the available details and any known workarounds, so that users are not left uninformed indefinitely. The window may be extended only by mutual agreement with the reporter, typically for issues that require coordination with upstream projects.

Target remediation timelines are guided by CVSS v3.1 severity:

| Severity (CVSS v3.1) | Target time to fix or mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Critical (9.0–10.0) | ~14 days |
| High (7.0–8.9) | ~30 days |
| Medium (4.0–6.9) | ~90 days |
| Low (0.1–3.9) | next scheduled release |

These are targets, not guarantees; complex or upstream-coordinated issues may take longer.

## Disclosure Process

The Cozystack project follows a coordinated disclosure model.

- We ask reporters to keep details private until a fix or mitigation is available and users have had a reasonable opportunity to upgrade.
- When appropriate, maintainers may use GitHub Security Advisories or equivalent coordinated disclosure tooling to manage remediation and public disclosure.
- If appropriate, the project may request or publish a GHSA and/or CVE as part of the disclosure process.
- Fixes will normally be released in the supported version lines affected by the issue, subject to severity and feasibility.

Public disclosure will typically happen through one or more of the following:

- GitHub Releases and release notes
- project changelogs and documentation updates
- GitHub Security Advisories, when used for coordinated disclosure

## Project Security Practices

Security is part of the normal Cozystack development and release process. Current project practices include:

- maintainer-owned review through pull requests and `CODEOWNERS`
- automated pull request checks, including pre-commit validation, unit tests, builds, end-to-end testing, and static application security testing (CodeQL)
- release automation with patch releases, release branches, and backport workflows
- ongoing maintenance of packaged dependencies and platform integrations across supported release lines

Because Cozystack is an integration-heavy platform, some vulnerabilities may require coordination across multiple repositories or with upstream maintainers before a public fix can be released.

### Security response team and rotation

Vulnerability reports are triaged by the maintainers responsible for security response — [@kvaps](https://github.com/kvaps), [@lexfrei](https://github.com/lexfrei), [@tym83](https://github.com/tym83), [@matthieu-robin](https://github.com/matthieu-robin) and [@mattia-eleuteri](https://github.com/mattia-eleuteri) — and any maintainer can receive a report and route it. The team spans more than one organization (Ænix, HIDORA) and more than one country, rather than sitting with a single employer.

A rotating **Security Champion** owns the day-to-day security process on top of normal maintainer duties: the CVE-triage clock (ensuring CRITICAL findings are triaged within SLA), the weekly review of new scan issues, pipeline health, escalation of overdue items, review of the monthly public report before publication, and first response to incoming private vulnerability reports. The role **rotates every 6 months** among the maintainers (or by volunteering), with a **one-week handoff overlap** between champions. The current Security Champion is **[@tym83](https://github.com/tym83)**.

A quarterly security review (30–60 minutes) covers pipeline status, open Critical/High issues, accepted-risk decisions due for re-evaluation, the triage backlog, and process improvements; its outcomes feed the aggregate reporting under [`docs/security/reports/`](docs/security/reports/).

### Automated security analysis

Four automated controls run continuously against this repository and the artifacts built from it:

- **CodeQL** (static analysis). Runs on every pull request to `main`, on push to `main`, and on a weekly schedule. The Go database is built with CodeQL's `manual` build mode — each first-party module is compiled explicitly, so the analysis does not depend on the project `Makefile` (which fetches upstream tags) and stays reproducible. On a pull request CodeQL reports only alerts that are *new relative to `main`* and annotates them on the changed lines. New findings are expected to be resolved before merge — either by fixing the code, or, for a false positive or accepted risk, by dismissing the alert in the **Security → Code scanning** tab with a recorded reason (`False positive`, `Won't fix`, or `Used in tests`).
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** (supply-chain posture). Runs weekly and on branch-protection changes, and publishes results to the public Scorecard API at <https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/cozystack/cozystack>. Scorecard results are intentionally **not** uploaded to GitHub code scanning: it posts one alert per check, which would bury CodeQL's first-party findings. The scorecard.dev badge is the canonical view.

- **zizmor** (GitHub Actions static analysis). Audits the workflow definitions themselves for findings such as unpinned action references or over-broad `permissions`. It runs in two places: as a hook inside the `pre-commit` check, which **is** a required status check and therefore blocks merge, and as a standalone workflow triggered only by changes under `.github/workflows/` or to `.github/zizmor.yml`, which is not itself a required check. As with Scorecard, the SARIF is intentionally not uploaded to code scanning — the signal is the failing check.
- **Trivy** (dependency and container-image CVE scanning). An organization-wide pipeline scans every non-fork, non-archived repository in the `cozystack` organization: Go modules, Dockerfile base images and the container images referenced by the packaged charts, against NVD, vendor advisories and the GitHub Advisory Database. CRITICAL findings are scanned every 6 hours; HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW are collected into a weekly report. Findings are filtered for noise (dev and build-only dependencies, unfixed-upstream findings older than a year, already-triaged CVEs) and every remaining new finding becomes a tracked issue with a severity label and a triage checklist. Triage targets are tighter than the reported-vulnerability targets above: CRITICAL within 1 business day against a 7-day fix target, HIGH within 3 business days / 30 days, MEDIUM within 10 business days / 90 days, LOW within 30 days best-effort. Confirmed findings ship as a pinned-component bump in the next release, or as a patch release on a maintained line when severity warrants it. **These are targets and the project is not currently meeting them** — there is a backlog on both the triage and the remediation side, and the rotating role that owns those clocks is currently held by [@tym83](https://github.com/tym83). Per-finding detail and triage state are kept private until fixed, because they describe unfixed exposure in released artifacts. Aggregate reporting **is** public: monthly reports and a full backlog reconciliation are published under [`docs/security/reports/`](docs/security/reports/). Publishing the pipeline's own policy documents and scanning scripts, which hold no finding data, is outstanding.

Dependency updates are additionally automated by **Renovate** ([`.github/renovate.json`](.github/renovate.json)), which raises pull requests for Go modules, Dockerfile base images, GitHub Actions and a small number of regex-pinned references. The `helm-values` manager is disabled repo-wide, so the curated component images that make up the shipped platform are bumped by maintainers when preparing a release rather than by a bot.

CodeQL is intended to run as a required pull-request check, so that a newly introduced alert at error severity blocks merge until it is fixed or dismissed. It is **not** currently among the required status checks on `main` — those are `pre-commit` and `E2E Tests` — so today a new error-severity alert is expected to be resolved before merge by review convention rather than enforced by branch protection.

## Security Fixes and Announcements

Security fixes are published in normal release artifacts whenever possible. Users should monitor:

- monthly security reports and the backlog reconciliation: [`docs/security/reports/`](docs/security/reports/)
- GitHub Releases: <https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/releases>
- project changelogs in this repository
- the Cozystack website and documentation: <https://cozystack.io>

## Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope for private security reporting unless there is a clear Cozystack-specific impact:

- vulnerabilities that reproduce only on an end-of-life or unsupported version and not on any maintained line — such reports are still accepted and triaged, but the fix will normally be delivered on a maintained line rather than backported
- issues that require access already equivalent to cluster-admin, node root, or direct infrastructure administrator privileges, unless they bypass an expected Cozystack security boundary
- vulnerabilities that exist only in an upstream dependency and are not introduced or materially worsened by Cozystack packaging, configuration, or defaults
- requests for security best-practice advice without a concrete vulnerability

## Credits

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters in public advisories or release notes unless anonymous disclosure is requested.
